adherence-psychotropics,"Adherence to psychotropics
Adherence describes the extent to which a patient’s behaviours (when it comes to taking medicines or participating in other treatments) align with the treatment regimen agreed with their clinician. Deviation from treatment regimens, whether intentional or unintentional, is referred to as nonadherence. High rates of treatment nonadherence have been reported with psychotropics. Nonadherence to psychotropics increases the risk of relapse, hospitalisation, poor quality of life and suicide.
Adherence is more likely when clinicians and patients have a good working relationship and jointly participate in deciding on treatment regimens—use shared decision making. Ensure the patient understands the potential advantages of adhering to their treatment regimen and the potential disadvantages associated with treatment nonadherence (eg prematurely reducing or stopping treatment). Involving a local mental health team or patient outreach service can help promote adherence.
If treatment nonadherence is identified, raise the issue with the patient in a nonconfrontational manner. Explore the factors that are contributing to treatment nonadherence and implement individualised strategies to improve treatment adherence (see Table 8.25). Treatment adherence may be monitored by:
Factors that contribute to nonadherence to psychotropics
Strategies to address nonadherence to psychotropics
disagreement between the clinician and patient about the need for treatment or likely benefit
explore patient’s beliefs about medication; use a shared-decision making approach
if the patient consents, involve family, carers or significant others in discussions as appropriate
a poor patient–clinician relationship
establish a positive, trusting, collaborative relationship between the patient and clinician
stigma
address anticipated or perceived stigma around taking medication with motivational or supportive therapy
patient understanding about the reason for using medication, the dosing regimen, duration of treatment and expectations of treatment
promote understanding by:
conflicting advice about the need for, and potential benefits and harms of, treatment from other healthcare practitioners, family, carers, friends or other sources
anticipate sources of conflicting advice and discuss these with the patient, and others as appropriate
involve a pharmacist
ensure continuity of care
encourage communication between people involved in the patient’s treatment, including healthcare practitioners, family, carers and significant others
adverse experiences with drug treatment (eg adverse effects) or healthcare services
listen to the patient, acknowledge their experiences and discuss options
before starting treatment, advise the patient of potential adverse effects and withdrawal effects [NB1] and, when relevant, how they can be prevented
regularly assess for adverse effects, including asking about sexual or other potentially embarrassing adverse effects, and manage as relevant [NB2]
financial barriers to accessing treatment
explore and address financial barriers to access
features of the patient’s psychiatric disorder (eg concentration and memory difficulties, paranoia, low motivation) or comorbidities such as problem substance use, and medical disorders or their sequelae (eg low visual acuity, hearing loss, arthritis, limited mobility)
other lifestyle or social factors (eg chaotic lifestyle, work demands, homelessness, inadequate follow-up, poor social supports)
address barriers, as relevant, by:
complex treatment regimen
simplify treatment regimens by:
confusion regarding generic and brand names of drugs
inform the patient about generic and brand names of drugs
provide written consumer medicine information
limited health literacy or cultural and language barriers
promote health literacy through education
use appropriate language
use interpreters if required
utilise culturally appropriate health care providers
provide written consumer medicine information in the patient’s first language"
adjustment-disorder,"Diagnosing adjustment disorder
Adjustment disorder is a time-limited syndrome related to exposure to a stressor that is characterised by:
Additionally, adjustment disorder does not represent normal bereavement (see Grief) or meet the criteria for another identifiable psychiatric disorder (eg an anxiety disorder, major depression).
Children with adjustment disorder may exhibit behavioural problems (eg fighting, missing school, vandalising property) with or without depressive or anxiety symptoms.
If symptoms of adjustment disorder are severe and persistent, and have not responded to treatment, consider alternative diagnoses such as major depression or an anxiety disorder.

Treating adjustment disorder in adults and young people
The primary intervention for adjustment disorder is addressing the triggering psychosocial stressor, if feasible. Although there is little evidence to guide treatment, psychosocial interventions are frequently helpful, including psychoeducation, relaxation strategies, problem solving, stress management, and accommodation and financial guidance. Some patients may benefit from short-term counselling or supportive psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy).
Pharmacotherapy has a limited role in managing adjustment disorder—do not use antidepressants because they are not effective.
If difficulty sleeping is a significant feature, see Insomnia for treatment.
If anxiety symptoms are severe, cause significant functional impairment or have not adequately responded to psychosocial interventions, consider short-term use of a benzodiazepine. However, there is an absence of high-quality evidence for benzodiazepine benefit, and benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence. These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use; in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh the benefits (see Principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders). Intermittent use for severe exacerbations of anxiety is preferable to continuous treatment.
If short-term use of a benzodiazepine is required for anxiety associated with adjustment disorder, use:
If intermittent dosing is insufficient, use short-term continuous treatment at the lowest effective dose. Use:
If the patient is acutely agitated or has an acute behavioural disturbance, if possible use nonpharmacological measures to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated and is at risk of harming themselves or others, see the advice on drug therapy for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or older people.
If symptoms of adjustment disorder are severe and persistent, and have not responded to treatment, consider alternative diagnoses such as major depression or an anxiety disorder.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as adjustment disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Treating adjustment disorder in children
The primary intervention for adjustment disorder is addressing the triggering psychosocial stressor, if feasible. Although there is little evidence to guide treatment, psychosocial interventions are frequently helpful, including psychoeducation, counselling, relaxation strategies, problem solving and stress management. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy may be used. Psychosocial interventions can be provided in individual, group or family/carer formats.
Pharmacotherapy is not recommended for adjustment disorder in children; however, if symptoms of adjustment disorder are severe and persistent, and have not responded to psychosocial interventions, consider alternative diagnoses such as major depression or an anxiety disorder."
advanced-sleep-wake-disorder,"Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder
Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is a circadian rhythm disorder characterised by persistently early sleep onset and wake times (ie at least 2 hours earlier than desired sleep and wake times). Typically, older adults experience advanced sleep–wake phase disorder—they fall asleep between 6.00 and 9.00 pm, before they can complete social, family or work obligations, and wake in the early hours of the morning (between 2.00 and 5.00 am). This causes distress, disruption, reduced sleep time and daytime sleepiness. As such, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as late (or terminal) insomnia. Early morning awakenings can also be as symptom of major depression, which should be excluded.
Assess advanced sleep–wake phase disorder with a sleep diary. People with sleep–wake phase disorders tend to sleep less on weekdays, but receive sufficient sleep when sleep is not restricted (eg weekends, holidays). Formal actigraphy can assist with the diagnosis of advanced sleep–wake phase disorder.
If a persistently early sleep–wake routine causes daytime sleepiness and dysfunction, treat advanced sleep–wake phase disorder with the following steps to slowly adjust the circadian rhythm to a sleep–wake routine that provides sufficient sleep:
To maintain desired sleep–wake routine, advise the patient to:
If the above recommendations are not successful, refer the patient to a sleep expert."
agoraphobia,"Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia is the fear and avoidance of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing (eg public transport, queues, theatre), or in which help might not be available if the person suddenly develops a symptom that could be incapacitating or embarrassing (eg dizziness, derealisation, loss of bladder or bowel control, a panic attack). As a result of this fear, the person restricts activities, requires the presence of a companion, or endures agoraphobic situations despite intense anxiety.
Assess patients who have agoraphobia for other psychiatric disorders because agoraphobia is a common symptom of other anxiety disorders, and can also occur in major depression and psychotic disorders. For example:
Most people with agoraphobia develop it as a response to recurrent panic attacks. These panic attacks can also be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disorder.
Treatment involves managing the underlying condition and treating panic attacks, if they are a feature. Once anxiety is sufficiently reduced, use behavioural therapy with graded exposure to overcome the phobic avoidance.
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here."
anorexia-nervosa,"Overview of anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder characterised by restricted energy intake resulting in:
It is associated with significant morbidity (eg physiological effect associated with starvation, depression, anxiety) and mortality.
Anorexia nervosa has an estimated global lifetime prevalence of approximately 1% and affects females more than males (females account for approximately 90% of diagnoses). The disorder has a typical onset during mid to late adolescence and is heritable. People with obsessive or perfectionist traits, a history of trauma (emotional, sexual or physical abuse), restrictive dieting or familial leanness are at increased risk of developing the disorder.
There are 2 subtypes of anorexia nervosa, distinguished by the methods the person has used in the preceding months to restrict energy intake:
Patients with anorexia nervosa often present with medical complications (eg osteopenia) and psychological comorbidities (eg depression, anxiety); some complications may present many years after the disease onset.
Screening questions can be used to detect the possible presence of an eating disorder in those considered to be at risk. The SCOFF questionnaire is a screening tool validated for use in primary care.
Do you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full?
Do you worry that you have lost Control over how much you eat?
Have you recently lost more than One stone (6.35 kg) in a 3-month period?
Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin?
Would you say that Food dominates your life?
Each “yes” equals 1 point; a score of 2 indicates a likely diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.
Atypical anorexia nervosa is a diagnostic subcategory of the other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). Patients with atypical anorexia nervosa are not considered to be underweight for their age and height (eg have a body mass index (BMI) above 18.5 kg/m2); it is managed similarly to anorexia nervosa.

Principles of managing anorexia nervosa
Managing anorexia nervosa can be challenging; patients may deny the presence or the severity of their disorder, which makes it difficult for the clinician and the patient to agree on the management approach. Patient engagement is key to successful management of anorexia nervosa.
Comprehensively assess patients with anorexia nervosa to identify comorbid physical or psychiatric disorders, and any physical complications. Identify and address family and personal problems that may have contributed to the development of the condition.
The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (available via the Centre for Research on Eating Disorders at Oxford (CREDO) website) assesses severity of symptoms, which is relevant to accessing care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, see here for current information.
The treatment goals for anorexia nervosa are to first restore body weight to an appropriate body mass index (BMI); then to help the patient have a positive relationship with food and eating, by focusing on good psychosocial function and mental wellbeing. A multifaceted approach is required to manage anorexia nervosa, led by an eating disorder–informed therapist (ie a psychologist who is competent in using evidence-based therapies as funded by Medicare for eating disorders) with other health care professionals involved (eg dietician for nutritional restoration). Assessing for and managing medical complications can be lifesaving—barriers and delays in accessing care can have significant impact. Anorexia nervosa can lead to a range of severe cardiac, metabolic, endocrine and bone-related sequelae that may require hospitalisation; hypokalaemia and dehydration are common complications of purging and laxative misuse and can lead to cardiac dysrhythmia.
Treatment of anorexia nervosa is usually initiated in an outpatient setting unless the patient:
Because of the high levels of morbidity and mortality, consult a specialised eating disorder unit within 6 weeks of diagnosis to initiate an Eating disorder treatment plan (EDTP), even if the patient’s weight loss is not yet marked. Outpatient care is led by a general practitioner, in collaboration with a dietician and psychologist, using an EDTP.
Engaging with the community-based healthcare providers is key to ensuring successful management.
Use nutritional replenishment and psychological therapies to manage patients with anorexia nervosa. There is no evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatment for anorexia nervosa itself. Pharmacological treatment may be required for the management of medical complications associated with anorexia nervosa and psychiatric comorbidities.
The principles of managing atypical anorexia nervosa are similar to those described here, see Atypical anorexia nervosa for differences.
For considerations in managing anorexia nervosa in:
Outcomes are better for patients with anorexia nervosa who receive treatment early. After receiving treatment, approximately 40% of patients are symptom-free after 5 years. The remainder continue to be symptomatic, and up to 20% of patients are severely affected, with their psychosocial functioning impacted.
Family, carers or significant others may have to assume a large burden of care when a patient is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Useful resources are available from:

Considerations in managing anorexia nervosa in females of childbearing potential
It is preferable for anorexia nervosa to be in remission before pregnancy—otherwise, pregnancy outcomes are poorer. Advise patients with anorexia nervosa to delay conception until their symptoms are well controlled. See here for advice on contraception, preconception planning and the use of psychotropics in females of childbearing potential.

Considerations in managing anorexia nervosa during pregnancy
If a patient has active anorexia nervosa during pregnancy, the pregnancy is considered ‘high risk’ and should be managed by a specialist perinatal unit because of the increased risk of fetal death—admit the patient to hospital as soon as practical [Note 2].
Dieting often substantially improves during pregnancy. Some patients fear adverse outcomes from their eating disorder on the pregnancy—this can lead to a time-limited remission. Other patients may develop a recurrence or worsening of their disorder because of anxiety and a fear of loss of control provoked by the weight gain, food cravings and food aversions associated with pregnancy.
Usually people with a history of anorexia nervosa have a sufficient diet during pregnancy and do not significantly differ in their nutrient intake and dietary supplement use compared to females without an eating disorder. They are more likely to be diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia.
Other than increased fetal mortality rates, the literature about the association between anorexia nervosa and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are mixed and inconsistent. The finding that is most often replicated is that active anorexia nervosa is associated with smaller infant birth weights. Other adverse outcomes reported include:
The treatment of anorexia nervosa during pregnancy follows the same principles as for a nonpregnant patient, see Principles of managing anorexia nervosa. Patients should be treated by a multidisciplinary team involving an obstetrician, psychiatrist (or a specialist eating disorder service), dietitian and physician. Depending on the patient’s baseline symptoms, weight and medical status, the patient and fetus may require more frequent monitoring than usual, using blood tests (to detect anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbance and nutritional deficiencies) and ultrasounds (to monitor fetal growth). Ideally, a patient with anorexia nervosa should give birth in a tertiary hospital with specialist neonatal care and a psychiatric team. If this is not possible, seek advice from their psychiatrist and a paediatrician.
For advice on psychotropic use during pregnancy, see here.

Considerations in managing anorexia nervosa in the postpartum
In the postpartum, the principles of treating patients with anorexia nervosa are the same as at any other time. Mothers with anorexia nervosa are:
Parent–infant interactions tend to involve more control and conflict, and parents can project their distorted body image onto their children. Children of mothers with anorexia nervosa tend to be underweight for their age. Ongoing monitoring and management into the perinatal period is essential for both parent and infant.
For advice on psychotropic use while breastfeeding, see here.

Nutritional replenishment for anorexia nervosa
Nutritional replenishment in a patient with anorexia nervosa aims to restore body weight to an appropriate body mass index (BMI) (see Classification of weight according to body mass index). Nutritional replenishment is used in inpatient or outpatient settings, depending on the severity of symptoms and other patient factors (see Principles of managing anorexia nervosa).
Involve a dietician experienced in the treatment of eating disorders during nutritional replenishment because there is risk of refeeding syndrome in patients with anorexia nervosa. Refeeding syndrome is a serious and potentially fatal complication of aggressive refeeding of a patient who has been malnourished for a long period of time—it can result in rapid onset of hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia. However, underfeeding a severely malnourished patient in order to reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome, can also have negative consequences. To minimise the risk of refeeding syndrome and complications due to underfeeding, tailor nutritional replenishment to the patient’s needs. Monitor phosphate, potassium and magnesium, and administer electrolyte replacement if required—for management of electrolyte disturbances, see Hypokalaemia, Hypomagnesaemia and Hypophosphataemia. For further information on risks and management of refeeding syndrome, see here.

Psychological treatment for anorexia nervosa
Use psychological treatment in combination with nutritional replenishment in the management of all patients with anorexia nervosa. Specific training and protocols are required for psychological therapies for eating disorders; only a healthcare professional with appropriate expertise in the management of eating disorders (usually a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or occupational therapist) can deliver psychological treatment.
If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is present, see Managing psychological comorbidities of anorexia nervosa.
For children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa, use:
Of these, the most effective is manualised FBT where all family members are seen together—this has demonstrated improved physical and psychological outcomes. FBT involves family members to assist with the patient’s recovery, particularly to support interventions to restore weight (eg eating meals together).
For adults with anorexia nervosa, use individual psychological therapy see Table 8.10.

Medical complications of anorexia nervosa
An assessment of the patient’s symptoms and the severity of their disorder determines the setting (medical or psychiatric admission, or outpatient treatment) for medical stabilisation. Complications of anorexia nervosa may include:
If a complication of anorexia nervosa is secondary to malnutrition (eg fluid and electrolyte changes, pancreatitis), treatment should also include nutritional replenishment. If complications are caused by purging or other behaviours (eg Mallory-Weiss tears, parotid and salivary gland hypertrophy, conjunctival haemorrhage), these behaviours should be addressed with psychological treatment.

Managing psychiatric comorbidities of anorexia nervosa
The core psychiatric symptoms of anorexia nervosa (ie fear of gaining weight and body image disturbance) should be addressed with psychological therapy for anorexia nervosa.
Starvation causes psychiatric symptoms of anxiety, dysphoria, depressive symptoms and obsessional thinking, which should improve with nutritional replenishment. However, these symptoms may also be caused by a comorbid psychiatric disorder such as major depression or an anxiety disorder. Patients with anorexia nervosa should receive psychological therapy from a clinician that can differentiate starvation-related symptoms from a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Referral to a psychiatrist may be necessary.
If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is identified, refer to the management recommendations for the disorder. In choosing pharmacological treatment, consider the harm–benefit profile of the drug, in particular the:
Avoid antidepressants that cause QT-interval prolongation—patients with anorexia nervosa are at increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae because of possible electrolyte disturbances. Of the antidepressants, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline have a lower risk of QT-interval prolongation. For patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 14 kg/m2, start antidepressant treatment at half the usual starting dose; the dose adjustment schedule and maximum dose do not need to be reduced.
For management of acute agitation, see Approach to managing acute behavioural disturbance.
For ongoing agitation secondary to anorexia nervosa, a psychiatrist may use an antipsychotic or a benzodiazepine. Antipsychotics can reduce anorexic eating-related ruminations, psychological distress and may improve weight gain."
antidepressant-adverse-effects,"Overview of antidepressant adverse effects
This topic is intended to aid antidepressant choice by describing the likelihood of individual antidepressants to cause common adverse effects such as weight gain, sexual difficulties, central nervous system adverse effects, anticholinergic effects and gastrointestinal distress. See Table 8.28 for the relative frequency of these adverse effects. Antidepressants can also cause significant adverse effects such as serotonin toxicity, cardiac conduction disorders, suicidality, increased bleeding risk and hyponatraemia. Consult a source of drug information for comprehensive information on antidepressant adverse effects.
When choosing an antidepressant:
If a patient experiences an antidepressant adverse effect, consider whether it could be relieved by:
If the adverse effect cannot be addressed with the above measures, or is severe or unacceptable, it may be necessary to switch to another antidepressant.

Sexual difficulties associated with antidepressant use
Sexual difficulties are a common but under-reported adverse effect of antidepressants and a leading cause of nonadherence. Antidepressant-induced sexual difficulties can affect both males and females, and include effects on desire (libido), arousal and orgasm. Despite limited evidence of the comparative risk of sexual difficulties with antidepressants, the greatest risk has been observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and clomipramine (see Table 8.28).
Consider screening for sexual difficulties before starting an antidepressant then regularly throughout treatment. If the patient has sexual difficulties, consider other causes or contributors—see Low libido in females, Low libido in males, Orgasm difficulties in females, Erectile dysfunction or Premature ejaculation. In some cases, sexual difficulties can persist for some time after stopping an antidepressant, particularly an SSRI or SNRI.
There is limited evidence to guide the most appropriate strategy for managing antidepressant-induced sexual difficulties. Although sexual difficulties can resolve spontaneously, this is uncommon. Psychotherapy and physical exercise may improve symptoms.
For general strategies to manage antidepressant adverse effects, see here.

Cardiac conduction disorders with antidepressant use
High therapeutic doses of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can cause conduction deficits, which may result in arrhythmias and fatal heart block. For management of TCA poisoning, see here.
Some antidepressants can prolong the QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) and sudden cardiac death. To determine whether an antidepressant is likely to prolong the QT interval, refer to Table 11.2 and, for more detail, the Arizona CERT website.
Perform a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) before starting treatment with an antidepressant that can prolong the QT interval (eg citalopram, escitalopram, a tricyclic antidepressant [TCA]) [Note 1]. Also perform a baseline ECG before prescribing any antidepressant if the patient has risk factors for developing a prolonged QT interval, such as [Note 2]:
For information on assessing QTc interval, see here.
If a patient has a prolonged QT interval or risk factors for developing a prolonged QT interval:
If a patient develops torsades de pointes, see here for advice.

Suicidality associated with antidepressant use
In a small proportion of patients, antidepressants cause a transient increase in suicidality (occurring within the first 7 to 10 days of treatment); this effect has been most often observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Young people (up to the age of 30 years) are most susceptible to this effect. The mechanism is not fully understood but may relate to the induction of agitation or akathisia.
When starting an antidepressant for a patient, discuss the possibility of activation and suicidal thoughts, and develop a plan for responding to these symptoms if they occur. Monitor the patient closely for these effects at the start of treatment. See also Suicide risk.

Bleeding risk associated with antidepressant use
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can increase the risk of bleeding (eg gastrointestinal, uterine, intracranial or periprocedural bleeding). The likelihood of bleeding is increased if the patient has other bleeding risk factors. To minimise bleeding risk in these patients, choose an alternative antidepressant or address other bleeding risk factors (eg using a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection in patients taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID]).

Hyponatraemia associated with antidepressant use
Hyponatraemia can be caused by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Mild hyponatraemia is usually asymptomatic but patients may experience nausea and general malaise. If hyponatraemia is severe or develops rapidly, it can cause convulsions, coma or death.
Factors that further increase the risk of hyponatraemia include:
Routine measurement of serum sodium concentration is not required, but may be considered 3 to 4 weeks after starting treatment in patients at high risk of hyponatraemia.
If hyponatraemia occurs, see here for assessment and management. Stopping the causative drug is usually required. If the causative drug is an SSRI, subsequent rechallenge with the same or a different SSRI may be possible without recurrence of hyponatraemia."
antipsychotic-adverse-effects,"Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects
Adverse effects occur commonly with antipsychotics. The frequency of occurrence depends on the antipsychotic; see Table 8.31 for approximate relative antipsychotic adverse effect frequency.
It is crucial to reduce the impact and incidence of antipsychotic adverse effects by taking the following measures.
Before starting antipsychotic therapy, to guide antipsychotic choice:

Anticholinergic adverse effects of antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Antipsychotics cause anticholinergic adverse effects to varying degrees—see Table 8.31.
Treat mild peripheral anticholinergic effects (eg blurred vision, urinary hesitancy) symptomatically. Also see constipation, dry mouth and dry skin.
Urgent review and intervention is required for severe anticholinergic effects such as increased intraocular pressure, faecal impaction (see here for adults and here for children), delirium and cognitive impairment.
If anticholinergic adverse effects are severe or intolerable, options include:
Anticholinergic toxicity can occur with large doses of antipsychotics (eg overdose)—for management, see here.

Cardiometabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Antipsychotics differ in their potential to cause cardiometabolic adverse effects (eg weight gain, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertension)—see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies.
If a cardiometabolic adverse effect occurs:
To manage specific cardiometabolic adverse effects in adults, see:
Metformin can attenuate weight gain caused by antipsychotics (average weight loss 3 kg) and reduce other cardiometabolic adverse effects associated with antipsychotics. Consider using metformin in conjunction with ongoing lifestyle interventions if adjusting antipsychotic therapy is ineffective or not possible, lifestyle interventions are ineffective, and the patient:
Children taking an antipsychotic have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to the general population.
The monitoring schedule set out in Table 8.32 can be used as a guide, but more frequent assessment of some parameters is warranted in children:
Refer a child to a specialist if they develop:
There is inconsistent, limited evidence to support metformin for the management of weight gain in children taking an antipsychotic.

For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.

Extrapyramidal adverse effects of antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Dystonia is a sustained or brief muscle contraction resulting in twisting movements or abnormal postures. Dystonia often affects the face, neck and trunk but can be focal, multifocal, segmental (affecting more than one contiguous region) or generalised. Oculogyric crisis, laryngeal spasm and opisthotonus can occur.
Antipsychotic-induced dystonia occurs most often in young males. It generally develops within minutes to days of starting a new antipsychotic or increasing the antipsychotic dose, or starting or stopping an interacting drug.
To treat antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia, options include:
While therapy is being adjusted, for symptomatic treatment of antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia, use:
Following relief of acute signs, switch to oral benzatropine. A typical regimen is:
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Parkinsonism is typically seen in the early weeks of starting an antipsychotic or increasing the antipsychotic dose, or starting or stopping an interacting drug.
To treat antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, options include:
While therapy is being adjusted, for symptomatic treatment of antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, a typical regimen is:
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Tardive dyskinesia is a chronic movement disorder characterised by repetitive involuntary choreiform movements, particularly of the tongue, lips and mouth, but may include any part of the body. Tardive dyskinesia occurs after chronic use of some antipsychotics—see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies of extrapyramidal adverse effects.
To treat antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia, options include:
If specific treatment of tardive dyskinesia is required, seek specialist advice (eg psychiatrist, neurologist).
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Akathisia is an abnormal, uncomfortable sensation of restlessness and the urge to move.
To treat antipsychotic-induced akathisia, reduce the antipsychotic dose until the akathisia disappears, or if this is ineffective or not possible, switch to an antipsychotic less likely to cause extrapyramidal adverse effects—see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies of extrapyramidal effects.
If a child develops akathisia, refer to their specialist (eg psychiatrist) for advice on management.
Only a small proportion of patients respond to symptomatic treatment of akathisia with a drug—reducing the dose of or switching the antipsychotic is preferable. If an adult has intolerable akathisia, while adjusting antipsychotic therapy, consider:

Hyperprolactinaemia caused by antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects. For children taking an antipsychotic, more frequent measurement of blood prolactin concentration (every 3 months for the first year) is required.
Many antipsychotics can cause dose-dependent hyperprolactinaemia—see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies.
Hyperprolactinemia can cause infertility, sexual difficulties (eg decreased libido, impaired sexual arousal), gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual disturbance, erectile dysfunction and pubertal delay. Chronic hyperprolactinaemia may reduce bone mineral density, which is particularly concerning in young people who have not reached their peak bone mass and people with osteoporosis.
It is unclear how best to balance the harms and benefits of antipsychotic therapy in a patient with asymptomatic hyperprolactinaemia, but adverse effects are likely to arise if the blood prolactin concentration remains high.
If other causes of hyperprolactinaemia (eg pregnancy) have been excluded, management options include:
If hyperprolactinaemia does not resolve with the above actions, refer to an endocrinologist.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome caused by antipsychotics
Antipsychotics are a leading cause of neuroleptic malignant syndrome—for features, see here and for diagnostic criteria, see here.
If a patient has suspected or confirmed neuroleptic malignant syndrome, arrange immediate transfer to hospital because the syndrome is life-threatening. Treatment involves stopping the antipsychotic—for further treatment advice, see here.
Approximately one-third of patients with suspected or confirmed neuroleptic malignant syndrome redevelop the syndrome if an antipsychotic is restarted—seek advice from a psychiatrist to determine whether, and how, to restart antipsychotic therapy.

Orthostatic hypotension caused by antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Many antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension—see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies. Orthostatic hypotension usually subsides within a few days of starting treatment or a dose increase, or starting or stopping an interacting drug.
If orthostatic hypotension is severe and persistent, review and rationalise potentially contributing drugs (eg antihypertensives), reduce the antipsychotic dose if possible, or switch to an antipsychotic with less effect on blood pressure.

QT-interval prolongation caused by antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Seek specialist advice on preventing and managing QT-interval prolongation in a child taking an antipsychotic.
Many antipsychotics can prolong the QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) and sudden cardiac death. QT-interval prolongation is more likely with intravenous administration (eg for an acute behavioural disturbance). To determine whether an antipsychotic is likely to prolong the QT interval, see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies and the Arizona CERT website.
Because of the potential for QT-interval prolongation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended before starting an antipsychotic, unless therapy is expected to be short term (eg shorter than 24 hours). If it is not possible to perform an ECG before starting an antipsychotic in a patient with acute symptoms, perform an ECG as soon as practical. If the patient is at risk of developing prolonged QT interval, repeat ECG once the antipsychotic has reached steady state (usually after 3 to 5 half-lives of the drug). Risk factors for QT-interval prolongation include [Note 8]:
For information on assessing QTc interval, see here.
If the baseline QTc interval is longer than 500 milliseconds:
During antipsychotic therapy, if QTc interval becomes longer than 500 milliseconds or lengthens by more than 60 milliseconds, address modifiable risk factors (as above) and:
If a patient develops torsades de pointes, see here for advice.

Sedation caused by antipsychotics
For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.
Sedation is associated with all antipsychotics at high doses. Some antipsychotics also cause sedation within or below the optimal therapeutic range—see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies.
Sedation may be beneficial in the early phase of treatment if the patient is agitated but should be avoided long term—it can interfere with the patient’s recovery, safety and wellbeing.
Usually sedation is temporary and most pronounced when starting an antipsychotic or increasing the antipsychotic dose, or starting or stopping an interacting drug. Warn the patient about sedation and associated risks (eg effect on ability to drive and operate machinery safely)—reassure them that sedation usually reduces after 1 to 2 weeks. If unacceptable sedation continues beyond this time, consider changing the administration time or, if possible, reducing the antipsychotic dose. If this is ineffective or impractical, switch to a less-sedating antipsychotic—see Table 8.31."
approach-acute-behavioural-disturbance,"Overview of acute behavioural disturbance
This topic focuses on management strategies used for people of all ages with acute behavioural disturbance; these strategies are context-dependent, and much nuance is required for every individual.
For the management of acute agitation and altered mental state in palliative care, see the specific topic here.
There is variation in the management approach taken for acute behavioural disturbance across different age groups and settings (including emergency departments, general hospital wards, general practice clinics, other outpatient clinics or the person’s home)—refer to local protocols or consensus state guidelines if they are available. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others. If it is safe to do so, align management with the patient’s preferences.
Managing threatening or aggressive behaviour is challenging. Threatening or aggressive behaviour is an expression of an underlying problem or unmet need that requires management. This type of behaviour is a function of distress that should prompt the clinician to explore potential predisposing factors (eg physical, psychological, social, environmental factors). Often multiple factors can precipitate an acute behavioural disturbance (see Table 8.2) and multiple modes of intervention are necessary.
If a person presents with acute severe behavioural disturbance, they require urgent care and support to address the underlying issue, and the situation needs to be de-escalated immediately, particularly if there is an:
The management of acute behavioural disturbance is contextual, governed by:
Initial management steps are often undertaken simultaneously and cyclically, with assessment occurring throughout. Interventions vary depending on whether the patient’s presentation is differentiated (ie known medical or psychiatric history) or undifferentiated. Align intervenitons with the patient’s preferences, if it is safe to do so. Steps include:
Monitor the patient closely according to local protocols or consensus state guidelines—see Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance. If indicated, facilitate transport or transfer to an appropriate treatment setting and ensure they are comprehensively followed-up as soon as possible.
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with an acute behavioural disturbance.

Principles of care for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance
The approach to assessing and managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance varies according to individual patient factors, the risk of significant harm to self or others, and the setting. The principles of care must uphold the human rights of the person as well as prevent harm—see Box 8.5 for principles of care for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
Any healthcare professional involved in managing patients with acute behavioural disturbance must be trained in the safe and effective delivery of both nonpharmacological management and pharmacological management. Best practice is supported by a standardised multidisciplinary approach with governance. If possible, refer to local protocols and consensus state guidelines, and seek expert advice to assist in managing difficult cases. Legal requirements for management of acute behavioural disturbance must also be met.
If the patient requires immediate intervention because of an imminent threat of harm to self or others, the principle of ‘duty of care’ may be used as a rationale for medical intervention without obtaining consent. If in doubt, consider the likely consequences of not intervening. Seek expert advice from a senior colleague whenever possible. Intervening without consent may be regarded as assault; however, many patients do not have the capacity to consent to treatment in these situations (eg children, people with developmental disability or cognitive impairment, alcohol- or drug-affected people). If it is safe to do so, discuss the patient’s distress and behaviour, and management options, with them and/or their carer, guardian or substitute decision maker. For more detailed information, see:
Any form of restrictive practice (eg pharmacological management, physical or mechanical restraint) should only be used as a last resort, and reserved for patients whose behaviour poses an imminent risk of significant harm to self or others.
Restrictive practices are discouraged in all people, particularly children, older people, and people with developmental disability or cognitive impairment. If restrictive practices are required, they must be proportionate to the risk of harm, and be employed for the minimum duration that ensures the safety of the person and others; see here for more information.
Careful documentation of care for a person with acute behavioural disturbance is essential—at a minimum, record:

Determining the safety of intervening in acute behavioural disturbance
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
The approach to assessing and managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance varies according to individual patient factors, the risk of significant harm to self or others, and the setting.
In adults, particular behaviours are suggestive of imminent significant harm; see Box 8.6.
To direct management, it is important to establish early whether the patient’s behaviour:
A Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT) score can assist clinical decision making in an acute behavioural disturbance. It can be used to assess the imminent risk of significant harm to self and others and guide the clinician as to whether repeat doses of sedative drugs are required. Consider the SAT score in the context of the situation and the individual—see Table 8.1.
The SAT has been validated in adults to assess the efficacy of pharmacological management in acute behavioural disturbance and guide the requirement for repeat doses of sedative drugs. Individualise the target SAT score based on patient factors (eg response to nonpharmacological interventions, whether the patient needs to be sedated for investigations) and the ability to maintain patient and staff safety.
The SAT has not been validated for use in children and older people, but has been used in trials to assess the effect of sedation in acute behavioural disturbance in these groups.
In adults, a SAT score of +2 or +3, may indicate an imminent risk of significant harm and immediate intervention is indicated. In children, older people, and people with a developmental disability or cognitive impairment, measure the SAT score once the environment and their unmet needs are optimised (eg the patient is in a quiet space, attempts have been made to address hunger, thirst, pain and toileting). Consider the SAT score in the context of the patient’s baseline function and communication style (eg loud outbursts may be usual for individuals with dementia or a developmental disability). Give the patient space and observe them to understand their behaviour; ask their carer whether their behaviour is different to normal.

If there is an imminent risk of significant harm to self or others, and it is unsafe to intervene, summon support early (which may include security staff and/or police for adults) to assist in disarming and restraining the patient. Security staff are less often required or involved when managing a child compared to an adult. Tailor the approach to the individual—a noncoercive approach, where the patient feels safe, promotes de-escalation and reduces the risk of trauma.
Isolated practitioners, including general practitioners or community nurses, should not attempt to manage a patient with an acute behavioural disturbance when they are alone in the community (eg in the patient’s home). Seek help from an ambulance service and/or police and if possible, ensure personal safety by moving to a safe environment.

Reducing the risk of harm in acute behavioural disturbance
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
Always take steps to ensure the safety of the patient (eg self-harm, unrecognised systemic illness, iatrogenic complications) and others (eg aggression or significant harm to staff or others present).
Use environmental management (or adaption) and verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention as first-line strategies for all patients with acute behavioural disturbance, unless there is an imminent risk of significant harm to self or others, and/or an immediate risk to life. These measures can help to defuse the situation, instil trust between the clinician and the patient, and avoid more invasive interventions. If the patient does not respond to these initial strategies, rapid intervention may be required before a comprehensive assessment is possible.
To reduce a patient’s distress and risk of harm to self or others:
The optimal approach depends on the patient and the clinician. If the patient has an existing behavioural support plan [Note 1], use it to guide management and try to involve usual carers or family if available. Discussing the patient’s preferences for the management of acute behavioural disturbance in advance can help de-escalation during an event.
If police have brought an adult to a health care facility handcuffed because of their behaviour, urgently assess the person while they remain handcuffed with police in attendance. After the initial assessment, if it is safe to do so, police may remove the handcuffs. If it is unsafe, pharmacological management may be required before police can safely remove the handcuffs. Children and people with developmental disability should never be handcuffed.
To minimise the imminent risk of significant harm to self and others, all patients with acute behavioural disturbance require close observation (eg continuous visual surveillance, very frequent observations). The Department of Health Mental health triage tool is a guide for assessing the severity of disturbance and risk of harm. 
Transporting or transferring a patient between facilities is associated with risks to the patient and healthcare staff. Consider whether the benefit outweighs the potential harms (eg transferring a patient with dementia from a familiar care environment to an acute care facility may escalate their distress). See Transporting or transferring a patient before or after management of acute behavioural disturbance.

Assessing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
Only perform a comprehensive assessment when it is safe to do so; see Determining the safety of intervening in acute behavioural disturbance.
As a priority, assess and manage any life-threatening conditions—in children, life-threatening medical conditions rarely cause acute behavioural disturbance. In older people, acute behavioural disturbance is often due to delirium, which may be the only warning sign of significant deterioration and ought to be treated as a medical emergency.
The approach to assessing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance will depend on whether the behavioural disturbance is differentiated (ie there are known predisposing or precipitating factors contributing, such as a medical or psychiatric disorder) or undifferentiated. In children, a history can often be obtained from their accompanying parent or carer. In people with developmental disability, detailed guidance on assessing challenging behaviour is included here. An older patient may have delirium or a history of dementia that will help to guide management. If the patient has an existing behavioural support plan [Note 2], use it to guide management and try to involve usual carers or family if available.
Assessing a patient with an undifferentiated acute behavioural disturbance involves:
If it is safe to perform a comprehensive assessment, establish any potential precipitating and predisposing factors that may be contributing to the disturbance. Often multiple factors can precipitate an acute behavioural disturbance, all of which need to be managed. The principles of comprehensive assessment of behavioural disturbance in a person with developmental disability are described here and can be used as a framework for comprehensive assessment in other groups.
Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 include potential precipitating and predisposing factors for development of acute behavioural disturbance—they are not exhaustive. In young people, psychiatric disorders and substance use are common contributors to acute behavioural disturbance.

Nonpharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
Verbal de-escalation is the least invasive and, together with environmental management (adaption), is the preferred management strategy for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Talking to the patient with empathy helps to encourage negotiation and establish cooperation. Box 8.7 outlines the principles of verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention for acute behavioural disturbance.
Verbal de-escalation should be used in all patients; it can take place cyclically throughout the steps of assessing and managing acute behavioural disturbance. Verbal de-escalation provides an opportunity to assess whether:
Children, older people, and those with cognitive impairment are more likely to respond to early intervention with verbal de-escalation and harm mitigation (see Reducing the risk of harm in acute behavioural disturbance).
Both the physical environment and the clinician’s approach can reduce the risk of escalation and avert significant harm. The effectiveness of verbal de-escalation is specific to the individual patient and the clinician, and it may escalate the situation—be aware of your own limitations and triggers. Rotate staff and vary the environment as required throughout the de-escalation process.
Environmental management (adaption) is key to de-escalation in all patients, but is especially so for children, those with cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, and older people. Optimising the clinician's approach and the physical environment, without restricting the patient's human rights, can positively influence the patient's behaviour, reduce the risk of escalation and avert significant harm. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
Ideally, provide a ‘safe place’ for the patient—a quiet, low-stimulus space, with someone who cares about them alongside for support. The physical environment (eg emergency department) may add to their distress due to unfamiliarity, fear or sensory triggers (eg noise, lights, handling). The patient should not be assessed alone; the clinician assessing the patient should have at least one other staff member in attendance. Maintain the patient's privacy and give them space and physical distance to move around if it is safe to do so.
If possible, consider the following environmental management (adaption) strategies:
Children, older people and those with cognitive impairment are most likely to respond to environmental management (adaption) to defuse the situation.
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
In adults with acute behavioural disturbance, if verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention cannot be implemented, or do not elicit cooperation from the patient, consider increasing the staff-to-patient ratio. This involves utilising a quorum of staff, who visibly support the clinician negotiating with the patient. It may assist in gaining the patient’s cooperation with treatment (eg pharmacological management); however, if their distress or aggressive behaviour escalate and there is an imminent risk of significant harm, implementation of physical restraint to facilitate further urgent management may be necessary.
Increasing the staff-to-patient ratio may escalate the situation in children, older people and those with developmental disability; however, staff-to-patient ratios should be sufficient to allow safe and effective application of nonpharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance. Staff-to-patient ratios should support a therapeutic and person-centred approach.

Rotate staff and vary the environment as required throughout the de-escalation process.

Environmental management (adaption) is key to de-escalation in all patients, but is especially so for children, those with cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, and older people. Optimising the clinician's approach and the physical environment, without restricting the patient's human rights, can positively influence the patient's behaviour, reduce the risk of escalation and avert significant harm. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
Ideally, provide a ‘safe place’ for the patient—a quiet, low-stimulus space, with someone who cares about them alongside for support. The physical environment (eg emergency department) may add to their distress due to unfamiliarity, fear or sensory triggers (eg noise, lights, handling). The patient should not be assessed alone; the clinician assessing the patient should have at least one other staff member in attendance. Maintain the patient's privacy and give them space and physical distance to move around if it is safe to do so.
If possible, consider the following environmental management (adaption) strategies:
Children, older people and those with cognitive impairment are most likely to respond to environmental management (adaption) to defuse the situation.

Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
In adults with acute behavioural disturbance, if verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention cannot be implemented, or do not elicit cooperation from the patient, consider increasing the staff-to-patient ratio. This involves utilising a quorum of staff, who visibly support the clinician negotiating with the patient. It may assist in gaining the patient’s cooperation with treatment (eg pharmacological management); however, if their distress or aggressive behaviour escalate and there is an imminent risk of significant harm, implementation of physical restraint to facilitate further urgent management may be necessary.
Increasing the staff-to-patient ratio may escalate the situation in children, older people and those with developmental disability; however, staff-to-patient ratios should be sufficient to allow safe and effective application of nonpharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance. Staff-to-patient ratios should support a therapeutic and person-centred approach.

Physical and mechanical restraint
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
Physical restraint is a restrictive practice, referring to physical immobilisation of a patient. Physical restraint should only be used as a last resort after all other evidence-based, person-centred and proactive strategies have been attempted, and reserved for patients whose:
Restrictive practices are discouraged in all people, particularly children and older people, and people with developmental disability or cognitive impairment.
Temporary physical restraint may facilitate the administration of pharmacological therapy. Physical restraint must be proportionate to the risk of harm, and only be employed for the minimum duration that ensures the safety of the person or others; see here for more detailed information about restrictive practices in patients with a developmental disability. If physical restraint is required, document the rationale for its use, the type of restraint used, the patient’s response, whether consent was obtained, monitoring undertaken, the duration of restraint, and any adverse outcomes.
Physical restraint, especially in the prone position, has been associated with severe sequelae, including positional asphyxia, ventilatory depression, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis and cardiac arrest. If physical restraint is used, avoid prone restraint, and ensure the patient’s airway, breathing and circulation are not obstructed.
Physical restraint must only be implemented by a well-trained, practised and coordinated team following a local protocol or consensus state guideline. The safest physical restraint technique is to immobilise the patient’s limbs using a team approach. Ideally, 6 team members are required: one team member to immobilise each of the patient’s limbs by applying pressure to the patient’s main joints (eg shoulder and elbow; hip, knee and ankle), one to immobilise the patient’s head, and one to administer drugs if necessary. Apply a mask to the patient to prevent them from spitting at staff.
Continue to employ verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention techniques during physical restraint. Release the physical restraint as soon as it is safe to do so, or when the desired level of sedation is achieved—see the specific approach to Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults. Ensure documentation is completed each time a patient is physically restrained.
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others.
Mechanical restraint (a type of physical restraint) is a restrictive practice, referring to the use of specifically designed physical devices (eg four-point restraints) to immobilise a patient to prevent them from injuring themselves or others. Mechanical restraint should only be applied in extreme circumstances, as a ‘last resort’, after all other evidence-based, person-centred and proactive strategies have failed, and only when the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms.
Restrictive practices are discouraged in all people, particularly children and older people, and people with developmental disability or cognitive impairment. If mechanical restraint is required for an adult, it must be proportionate to the risk of harm, and only be employed for the minimum duration that ensures the safety of the patient or others. Legal authorisation, documentation, monitoring, and nursing care must be undertaken in accordance with the relevant legislation and local policies. If mechanical restraint is required, document the rationale for its use, the type of restraint used, the patient’s response, monitoring undertaken, the duration of restraint, and any adverse events. For more information, see:
If a patient in police custody presents with mechanical restraint in place, employ verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention techniques and release the restraint as soon as it is safe to do so, or when the desired level of sedation is achieved—see the specific approach to Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults. Ensure documentation is completed each time a patient is physically restrained using mechanical restraint devices.

Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance
Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance is complex and varies according to patient groups. The aim of pharmacological management is to safely calm, soothe or sedate the patient in order to manage any precipitating or predisposing factors contributing to the acute behavioural disturbance. Pharmacological management is a restrictive practice that is sometimes referred to as ‘chemical restraint’. Nonpharmacological management techniques are preferred for first-line management of acute behavioural disturbance and should continue alongside any pharmacological regimen, both before and after drug administration; however, if there is an imminent risk of significant harm to the patient or others, immediate sedation may be required.
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others. For detailed discussion and recommendations on pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in specific groups of patients, see the individual topics:

Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
After administering any sedative drug to a patient with acute behavioural disturbance, always monitor them closely to assess the efficacy of interventions and to identify potential harms. Refer to local protocols or consensus state guidelines if they are available. Observe all patients administered a sedative drug with 1:1 continuous visual nursing observation for adverse effects of drugs. Once it is clear they are not oversedated and can maintain a patent airway, intermittent monitoring is sufficient; specify the frequency of nursing observations and medical reviews clearly. Each patient is different and monitoring schedules must be flexible (eg older people who have been administered sedation are at increased risk of falls and require continuous visual monitoring).
The Joint College’s Guidelines for Safe Care for Patients Sedated in Health Care Facilities for Acute Behavioural Disturbance recommend the following minimum monitoring and equipment requirements for a patient who has been administered any sedative drug:
Minimum monitoring and equipment requirements for managing patients after parenteral sedation are:
In community settings (especially in rural and remote areas) if the minimum monitoring and equipment requirements are not available, a senior clinician needs to make a risk assessment about the relative risk of the situation proportionate to the risk of the sedative drug.
Tailor monitoring depending on the:
When monitoring the patient, provide a calm and quiet environment, and minimise unnecessary stimulation or irritation; however, balance this with the need to carry out required observations to detect complications and intervene quickly if they arise.

Transporting or transferring a patient before or after management of acute behavioural disturbance
Transporting or transferring a patient with acute behavioural disturbance is complex and involves multiple risks, including risk to the patient, risk to healthcare staff, and risk associated with the transfer or transport itself. Consider whether the benefit of transporting or transferring the patient outweighs the potential harms (eg transferring a patient with dementia from a familiar care environment to an acute care facility may escalate their distress). Ensure the safety of both the patient and healthcare staff (see Reducing the risk of harm). Summon adequate support early if necessary (eg ambulance, security staff, police).
For a patient who retains decision-making capacity, transport cannot proceed without their consent. If the patient lacks capacity to consent, compliance with relevant legislation is imperative (see Principles of care for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance). Ensure a record of the patient’s observations, drug administration and physical restraint, and required legal documentation, accompany the patient in transport.
Before initiating transport or transfer, ensure that any precipitating or predisposing factors that could be contributing to the patient’s acute behavioural disturbance are addressed (eg hunger, thirst, hypoglycaemia, pain, urinary retention, sepsis or trauma). Arrange appropriate transport (eg police vehicle, ambulance), considering the duration of the trip and potential delays. Also arrange supervision or a medical escort, informed by the patient’s clinical requirements (eg potential requirement for further sedation). If the patient has been administered sedation, a clinician who can manage airway compromise and respiratory depression en route should escort the patient. Resuscitation equipment and continuous monitoring of vital signs must be available.
If an adult patient has been mechanically restrained, reconsider the need for ongoing restraint; if it is essential, provide a suitable means of safe restraint en route. Restraint must be proportionate to the risk of harm, and only be employed for the minimum duration that ensures the safety of the patient and others; see Mechanical restraint.
If a long journey is expected, provide instructions for repeated sedative drug administration, if required. If a drug is required during transport, use a dose that maintains a safe level of sedation for the patient and healthcare staff.
In some cases, it may be necessary to enlist a specialist medical retrieval team to anaesthetise, intubate, and ventilate the patient for safe transport.

Follow-up
Following management of acute behavioural disturbance, the patient should be allowed to recover in a calm environment with regular monitoring. All patients require a comprehensive clinical assessment after they have recovered to identify the cause, assess management, and to prevent future events; see Assessing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
Ensure documentation of management is complete, including nonpharmacological and pharmacological management. If physical restraint was used, document the rationale for its use, the type of restraint used, the patient’s response, monitoring undertaken, the duration of restraint, and any adverse events.
Arrange appropriate medical or psychiatric follow-up, as required. If appropriate, discharge the patient into the care of a responsible adult, with written instructions about resumption of normal activities (eg driving). Sedative drugs can continue to cause significant cognitive impairment for several days following exposure. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery for at least 3 days after discharge or until review by their general practitioner.
Audit the assessment and management of acute behavioural disturbances for compliance with local protocols, to identify trends and prevent future adverse events."
attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder,"Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
The core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Children with ADHD exhibit these symptoms with greater frequency and severity than other children at a comparable level of development. ADHD occurs in 5 to 7% of school-aged children. It is a chronic condition that can cause considerable disruption to the lives of children and their families or carers and has a major impact on educational outcomes. Accurate diagnosis and treatment with a comprehensive multimodal intervention using nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, as appropriate, can make a significant difference to the child and their family.
Children with ADHD commonly have comorbid psychiatric disorders and higher rates of developmental disability than other children.
Management of ADHD is multifaceted and an individualised multimodal management plan should be developed. The management plan should be made in collaboration with the child, family or carers, and teachers; it should outline the treatment approach and developmental goals.

Diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requires a comprehensive assessment (including medical, developmental and psychosocial assessments) using information from multiple sources (eg teachers, family or carers).
Diagnosis of ADHD requires that:
If a diagnosis of ADHD is suspected in a child who has not started primary school or if the primary clinician does not have the capacity to undertake a comprehensive assessment, refer to a specialist experienced in assessing children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
Parent and teacher rating scales are not diagnostic tools but can be an important guide to ascertaining the frequency and severity of a child’s symptoms, and monitoring the efficacy of treatment in reducing symptoms.
Assess for coexisting conditions, including:

Nonpharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Nonpharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be provided as a component of an individualised multimodal management plan. The management plan should be made in collaboration with the child, family or carers, and teachers; it should outline the treatment approach and developmental goals.
Provide psychoeducation to the child, parents or carers that includes information about ADHD, any comorbid conditions and treatment options.
Nonpharmacological interventions for ADHD can include:
Advise parents or carers of the importance of having a close relationship with staff in the child’s school—they can help monitor the effectiveness of treatment and ensure the child receives additional help for learning and other developmental problems.
Routine dietary modification is not indicated to reduce symptoms of ADHD because only a minority of children are sensitive to the effects of synthetic dyes, flavours and preservatives. Use of a food diary can be beneficial to link symptoms to dietary exposures. Refer children in whom a link between certain foods and ADHD symptoms is observed to a dietitian for consideration of dietary modification.
Do not use dietary supplements (eg omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals) unless the child has a deficiency.
Give family or carers information about relevant support groups and community organisations where they can receive training about managing children with ADHD (see ADHD Australia).

Overview of pharmacotherapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Nonpharmacological management is first line for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Pharmacotherapy may be added, depending on the child’s age, as part of an individualised, multimodal management plan. The plan should outline the treatment approach and developmental goals. Pharmacotherapy should be prescribed by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children—follow the principles of psychotropic use in children.
Because of the adverse effects associated with drugs used to treat ADHD in children, take baseline measurements, such as height, weight, heart rate and blood pressure before starting pharmacotherapy (see also Monitoring during drug treatment of ADHD).
Stimulants are first-line drugs for the treatment of ADHD in children.
Atomoxetine may be used if a stimulant cannot be used, is not tolerated, when there is comorbid Tourette syndrome or a severe anxiety disorder, or there is a risk of misuse of stimulants (either by the child or the adult supporting the child).
Guanfacine is usually reserved for children with ADHD who do not tolerate stimulants, or as an adjunct to a stimulant in children who have had an inadequate response. Guanfacine is also useful in children with a comorbid tic disorder (eg Tourette syndrome).
Clonidine has a similar role to guanfacine but its use is limited by its short half-life, which necessitates multiple-daily dosing.
The optimal duration of pharmacotherapy for ADHD is unclear—review the need for ongoing treatment in children at least once a year (see Duration of pharmacotherapy for ADHD).

Stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Stimulants (dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate) are first-line drugs for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Stimulants improve attention, decrease impulsiveness and reduce hyperactivity. General behaviour and interactions with peers and family or carers may also improve.
Do not use stimulants in children younger than 6 years, except in exceptional circumstances and under the close supervision of a specialist.
Prescribers should be familiar with and follow state and territory health regulations on prescribing stimulants, including the requirements for assessing the risk of misuse of stimulants (either by the child or the adult supporting the child).
There is no clear evidence to suggest that one stimulant is more effective than another for ADHD in children. Individual response to stimulants varies; if a child does not respond to one stimulant, it is likely that they will respond to another. Stimulant choice may also be influenced by tolerability.
Stimulants and their formulations can be distinguished by their duration of effect (see Table 8.4).
Drug (brand name example)
Frequency of dosing
Short duration of effect
dexamfetamine (eg Dexamfetamine)
2 to 3 times daily
methylphenidate (eg Ritalin 10)
2 to 3 times daily
Long duration of effect
lisdexamfetamine—13-hour duration (eg Vyvanse)
once daily
methylphenidate—8-hour duration (eg Ritalin LA) [NB1]
once daily
methylphenidate—12-hour duration (eg Concerta) [NB1]
once daily
When deciding which drug or formulation to initiate treatment with, consider factors such as:
There is significant interindividual variability in stimulant dosing requirements in children, and doses should be titrated according to response and tolerability. Optimised dosing may require trials of different regimens—for example:
If a patient’s symptoms have not significantly improved, despite optimising the dosage regimen and using the maximum tolerated dose for 1 month, trial another stimulant. A child who does not respond to or cannot tolerate the first stimulant may still respond to or tolerate another stimulant. If there is still no response to adequate trials of stimulants, review the diagnosis, consider possible comorbid diagnoses, and consider alternative pharmacotherapy for ADHD.
Because of the anorectic properties of stimulants, doses should be given at or immediately after meals. Avoid late evening doses to reduce the risk of developing tolerance and insomnia. In obese children, use ideal body weight when calculating the maximum dose.
There is a lack of consistent evidence for dosing of methylphenidate. Treatment is usually initiated with the short-acting formulation to determine the effective dose. If short-acting methylphenidate is preferred for ADHD in a child 6 years or older, a suitable regimen is:
Once the optimal dose of short-acting methylphenidate is established, consider switching to a long-acting formulation. The choice of formulation depends on whether control of symptoms was achieved with twice or three-times daily dosing, and whether an 8- or 12-hour duration of effect is desired. If previous control was achieved with twice-daily dosing, a formulation that provides an 8-hour duration of effect is most suitable. If previous control was achieved with three-times-daily dosing, a formulation that provides a 12-hour duration of effect is most suitable. The starting dose of the long-acting formulation should be as close as possible to the patient’s total daily dose of the short-acting formulation. If long-acting methylphenidate is preferred for ADHD in a child 6 years or older, a suitable regimen is:
If dexamfetamine is preferred for ADHD in a child 6 years or older, a suitable regimen is:
If lisdexamfetamine is preferred for ADHD in a child 6 years or older, a suitable regimen is:
For patients switching to lisdexamfetamine from another stimulant (eg dexamfetamine, methylphenidate), the starting dose of lisdexamfetamine is 30 mg regardless of the daily dose of stimulant the patient was stable on.

There is no clear evidence to suggest that one stimulant is more effective than another for ADHD in children. Individual response to stimulants varies; if a child does not respond to one stimulant, it is likely that they will respond to another. Stimulant choice may also be influenced by tolerability.
Stimulants and their formulations can be distinguished by their duration of effect (see Table 8.4).

Atomoxetine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Atomoxetine may be used in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) if:
If atomoxetine is indicated for ADHD in a child 6 years or older, use:

Guanfacine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Guanfacine is a nonstimulant alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist that may be useful in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who:
If guanfacine is indicated for ADHD in children 6 years or older, a suitable regimen is:

Clonidine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Clonidine has a similar role to guanfacine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but its use is limited by its short half-life, which necessitates multiple-daily dosing. Clonidine does not appear to affect inattention symptoms and may cause depression; beneficial effects of clonidine may take several weeks to occur.
If clonidine is indicated for ADHD in children 6 years or older, a suitable regimen is:

Monitoring during drug treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
Review a child regularly during treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (eg monthly during the early stages of treatment, then at least a few times a year when stable). Monitor:
Ensure family or carers of children with ADHD have contact with teachers before review appointments to obtain information about performance at school. Questionnaires may be used to help gather information from different sources and may help with monitoring of benefits and adverse effects.

Duration of pharmacotherapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children
The optimal duration of pharmacotherapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is unclear. Review the need for treatment at least once a year. Consider factors such as:
If it is deemed appropriate, a trial without pharmacotherapy may be attempted. Preferably the trial should occur at a time likely to cause the least disruption (eg during school holidays).
Consider the following when stopping a drug for ADHD:
If symptoms re-emerge when treatment for ADHD is stopped, and cause distress or functional impairment, restart the drug. When restarting the drug, restart at the lowest starting dose and gradually increase according to response (rather than starting at the dose previously taken).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young people and adults
There is increased recognition that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms can persist in young people and adults. It is important to plan the transition from child to adult services; however, there is limited evidence to guide the optimal duration of pharmacotherapy.
There is increased interest in diagnosing ADHD in adults not previously diagnosed in childhood; however, diagnosing ADHD in adulthood is a controversial area and is difficult because it is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, major depression, bipolar disorder, personality disorder and substance abuse disorder. If ADHD is suspected in an adult not previously diagnosed, refer to a psychiatrist.
Management of ADHD in adults is a specialised area and is beyond the scope of these guidelines."
avoidant-restrictive-food-intake-disorder,"Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is the least common eating disorder in adults, with a general population point prevalence of approximately 0.5%. It is more common in children, accounting for up to one in five presentations.
ARFID is characterised by a pattern of food avoidance or restriction that is not associated with excess concern about body image and results in at least one of the following:
There is little evidence to support the use of specific psychological therapies for ARFID; however, behavioural refeeding, graded food exposure and cognitive therapies may provide some benefit. Specific training and protocols are required for psychological therapies for eating disorders; only a healthcare professional with appropriate expertise in the management of eating disorders (usually a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or occupational therapist) can deliver psychological therapy.
There is no evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatment for ARFID.

binge-eating-disorder,"Overview of binge eating disorder
Binge eating disorder is characterised by recurrent episodes of uncontrolled overeating—it is the most common eating disorder. It has a global lifetime prevalence of approximately 3% in females and 1% in males. Binge eating disorder has a usual onset during late adolescence and early adulthood. People with a history of trauma, restrictive dieting, family history of bulimia nervosa, or high body mass index (BMI) are at increased risk of developing the disorder. Patients usually present for treatment many years after the onset of symptoms, with concerns about weight loss or medical or psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety.
The core diagnostic criteria of binge eating disorder are:
Binge eating is usually rapid, solitary, and carried out in the absence of hunger or until the person is uncomfortably full. Patients are often of adequate weight or have a high BMI. Overvaluation of body weight or shape is sometimes present.
If a patient meets all the diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder, except their symptoms are of shorter duration (ie less than 3 months) and the binge eating occurs at a lower frequency (ie less than once weekly), they are diagnosed with subthreshold binge eating disorder. Although subthreshold binge eating disorder is a diagnostic subcategory of Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED), it is managed the same as binge eating disorder.

Principles of managing binge eating disorder
The primary goals of treatment in the management of patients with binge eating disorder are to first reduce the frequency of binge-eating episodes, reduce other associated symptoms and manage associated comorbidities; and then to help the patient have a positive relationship with food and eating, by focusing on good psychosocial function and mental wellbeing. Patients are primarily managed in an outpatient setting with psychological therapies as a first-line treatment. Patients are often started on pharmacological treatment when psychological therapies are ineffective or difficult to access.
Assess patients for medical complications, in particular those associated with obesity such as diabetes and hypertension.
The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (available via the Centre for Research on Eating Disorders at Oxford (CREDO) website) assesses severity of symptoms, which is relevant to accessing care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, see here for current information.
Admit patients to hospital [Note 1] who:
If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is identified, refer to recommendations for the disorder; and manage it concurrently. Substance abuse and deliberate self-harm need to be addressed first to enable a person with binge eating disorder to engage in therapy.
Better outcomes are seen in patients with an early response to treatment (within the first weeks of treatment), no history of drug abuse or obesity, and those with good interpersonal function. Approximately 50% of patients make a full recovery, 30% a partial recovery and 20% continue to be symptomatic after treatment.
Discuss contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use with females with binge eating disorder, see here for information.
The treatment of binge eating disorder during the perinatal period follows the same principles as above; however, use pharmacological treatment with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Depending on the patient’s baseline symptoms, weight and medical status, the parent and fetus or infant may require more frequent monitoring than usual.
For advice on psychotropic use during pregnancy, see here and use while breastfeeding, see here.

For patients with a high body mass index (BMI), consider implementing behavioural weight-loss therapy concurrently with psychological therapies for binge eating disorder. Behavioural weight-loss therapy may be more effective than CBT in attaining weight loss in the short term, but long-term efficacy is lacking. For some patients with a high BMI, it is more beneficial to treat the binge eating disorder, particularly before trying to achieve weight loss. For information on the management of obesity, see here.

Pharmacological treatment for binge eating disorder in adults
Pharmacological treatment may be used for the management of binge eating disorder in patients who have not responded to psychological treatment alone, or where there is difficulty in accessing treatment.
Lisdexamfetamine can be used by specialists for the treatment of moderate to severe binge eating disorder. An appropriate regimen is:
Fluoxetine may be considered for binge eating disorder, particularly if the patient has anxiety or a comorbid mood disorder (eg major depression or bipolar depression). If appropriate, use:
Topiramate may be helpful in reducing binge-eating episodes in binge eating disorder; however, the evidence base is weaker than for antidepressants. Patients who have failed treatment with other agents may be initiated on topiramate by a specialist."
body-dysmorphic-disorder,"Overview of body dysmorphic disorder
Body dysmorphic disorder is an obsessive compulsive–related disorder that is characterised by an excessive preoccupation with physical flaws that causes clinically significant distress, and repetitive behaviours or cognitions. The level of insight can be variable, ranging from good insight to having delusional beliefs.
Symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder in children are similar to those in adults.

Approach to managing body dysmorphic disorder in adults and young people
Body dysmorphic disorder is ideally managed by an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)–spectrum specialised practitioner, but they may be difficult to access.
Because there is limited evidence to inform the management of body dysmorphic disorder, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from evidence in obsessive compulsive disorder.
Use a combination of psychosocial and pharmacological treatment for body dysmorphic disorder. Some patients require pharmacological treatment before they can actively engage in psychosocial interventions. Pharmacotherapy can also be used as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
Because there is limited evidence on the approach to managing body dysmorphic disorder during pregnancy and after giving birth, the advice on obsessive compulsive disorder during the perinatal period can be used as a guide. For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Approach to managing body dysmorphic disorder in children
Because there is limited evidence to inform the management of body dysmorphic disorder, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from evidence in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Use psychosocial interventions as first-line treatment for body dysmorphic disorder in children. If there is no response to, or nonengagement in psychosocial interventions after 12 weeks, consider pharmacotherapy for children with moderate to severe functional impairment.
Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use this concurrently with psychosocial interventions where possible.

Psychosocial interventions for body dysmorphic disorder
Because there is limited evidence to inform the management of body dysmorphic disorder, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from evidence in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Psychosocial interventions for body dysmorphic disorder include psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with an exposure and response prevention (ExRP) component.
In children, psychosocial interventions should be adapted to their chronological and developmental age. Psychosocial interventions include psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural therapy, and should involve the child and their family, carers or significant others.

Initial pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder in adults and young people
Follow the approach to managing body dysmorphic disorder in adults and young people. Psychosocial interventions should be used concurrently with pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder
If an antidepressant is indicated for body dysmorphic disorder in adults and young people, initial choice should be informed by:
Because there is limited evidence for the management of body dysmorphic disorder, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from evidence in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) are first-line drugs, and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine) are an option if patients have a poor response to, or do not tolerate, SSRIs.
Often the doses of SSRIs and SNRIs required to effectively treat body dysmorphic disorder are higher than the doses for other indications. If using a dose in the upper range of those recommended below, the patient must be monitored for adverse effects, including with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Because the risk of QT-interval prolongation appears to be higher for citalopram compared to other SSRIs, the maximum recommended dose of citalopram is comparatively lower than the maximum doses of other SSRIs.
Many patients relapse when antidepressants are withdrawn, so require long-term pharmacotherapy.
If an SSRI or SNRI is considered appropriate for body dysmorphic disorder, individualise the choice of drug (see above). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Use:

Initial pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder in children
Follow the approach to managing body dysmorphic disorder in children. Psychosocial interventions are first line for body dysmorphic disorder. Consider pharmacotherapy if there is insufficient response to psychosocial interventions, or symptoms are severe and causing significant impairment. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children.
Because there is limited evidence for the management of body dysmorphic disorder, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from evidence in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line drugs; however, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events. Response may take up to 12 weeks—provide support and close monitoring during this time. Response to pharmacotherapy is more effective in combination with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder in children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for body dysmorphic disorder, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), seek expert advice—the doses of SSRIs required to effectively treat body dysmorphic disorder are often higher than the doses for other indications. In children 12 years and older, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for body dysmorphic disorder, use:

Follow-up and duration of pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.2). Response to treatment may become apparent after several weeks; full benefit may take 8 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder in adults and young people
Consider modifying treatment for body dysmorphic disorder in adults and young people if symptoms persist despite:
Options for treatment modification include:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.
Psychiatrists may use clomipramine for body dysmorphic disorder; however, intolerance commonly limits the use of clomipramine and toxicity in overdose must be considered. Lower doses are used in older or frail patients. Clomipramine can cause changes in cardiac conduction—an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained before treatment is started and repeated once the dose is stabilised, usually after 6 weeks. If either ECG shows abnormalities, seek advice from a cardiologist before starting or continuing treatment. If clomipramine is considered appropriate for body dysmorphic disorder, a suitable regimen in adults and young people is:
In treatment-resistant body dysmorphic disorder, psychiatrists may use other antidepressants or a combination of drugs. There have been some positive trials combining serotonergic drugs with other drugs that augment their effect. Aripiprazole and risperidone have the strongest evidence base as augmenting agents; there is some evidence in support of olanzapine, levetiracetam and quetiapine. However, there is limited evidence supporting this practice and the adverse effects of antipsychotics should be considered.

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder in children
Refer to a child psychiatrist or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input if symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder persist despite all of the following:
Psychiatrists may consider a trial of clomipramine for body dysmorphic disorder in a child; however, intolerance commonly limits the use of clomipramine and toxicity in overdose must be considered. If there is insufficient response to clomipramine, psychiatrists may augment clomipramine with an atypical antipsychotic; however, there is limited evidence supporting this practice and the adverse effects of antipsychotics should be considered."
bulimia-nervosa,"Overview of bulimia nervosa
Bulimia nervosa is a common eating disorder, characterised by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain. It has a community lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% in females and 0.5% in males and has a usual onset during older adolescence and young adulthood. People with a history of trauma (physical, sexual or emotional abuse), restrictive dieting, family history of an eating disorder, or high body mass index (BMI) may be at increased risk of developing bulimia nervosa. Patients usually present many years after the onset of the disorder with concerns about weight loss or medical and psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety.
The signs and symptoms of bulimia nervosa include:
Patients with bulimia nervosa often present with psychological comorbidities (eg depression, anxiety). Patients with bulimia nervosa may present with medical complications such as hypokalaemia or dehydration from purging behaviours.
Screening questions can be used to detect the possible presence of an eating disorder in those considered to be at risk. The SCOFF questionnaire is a screening tool validated for use in primary care.
If a patient meets all the criteria for bulimia nervosa, except their symptoms last for a shorter duration (ie less than 3 months) and the purging behaviours occur at a lower frequency (ie less than once weekly), they are diagnosed with subthreshold bulimia nervosa. Although subthreshold bulimia nervosa is a diagnostic subcategory of Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED), it is managed the same as bulimia nervosa (see Principles of managing bulimia nervosa).

Principles of managing bulimia nervosa
The primary goals of managing bulimia nervosa are first to reduce the number of episodes of binge eating and purging, or extreme weight control methods, and then to help the patient have a positive relationship with food and eating, by focusing on good psychosocial function and mental wellbeing. Patients are primarily managed in an outpatient setting with a healthcare professional with expertise in managing eating disorders, usually a psychologist.
Assessing for and managing medical complications can be lifesaving. Monitor patients with bulimia nervosa closely for metabolic consequences of purging behaviours, such as hypokalaemia and dehydration. Hypokalaemia is a common complication of purging behaviour and laxative abuse, and can lead to cardiac dysrhythmia. For information on the management of hypokalaemia, see here.
The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (available via the Centre for Research on Eating Disorders at Oxford (CREDO) website) assesses severity of symptoms, which is relevant to accessing care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, see here for current information.
Admit patients to hospital [Note 1] who:
If a pregnant patient with bulimia nervosa is frequently binge eating or purging (ie 3 or more times a week), refer them to a perinatal unit for specialist management.
There is a very high occurrence (over 90%) and a range of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with bulimia nervosa, including:
If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is identified, refer to recommendations for the disorder and manage it concurrently. Substance abuse and deliberate self-harm need to be addressed first to enable a person with bulimia nervosa to engage in therapy.
Better outcomes are seen in patients with an early response to treatment (within the first weeks of treatment), no history of drug abuse or obesity, and in those with good interpersonal function. Approximately 50% of patients make a full recovery, 30% a partial recovery and 20% continue to be symptomatic after treatment.
It is preferable for bulimia nervosa to be in remission before pregnancy—otherwise pregnancy outcomes are poorer. Advise patients with bulimia nervosa to delay conception until their symptoms are well controlled. See here for advice on contraception, preconception planning and the use of psychotropics in females of childbearing potential.
For considerations in managing bulimia nervosa in:
Useful resources are available from:

Considerations in managing bulimia nervosa during pregnancy
If a patient has active bulimia nervosa during pregnancy, the pregnancy is considered ‘high risk’ because of the increased risk of fetal death. Refer the patient to a specialist unit for perinatal care as soon as practical—hospitalisation is sometimes required [Note 2].
Purging and binge eating often substantially decrease during pregnancy. Some patients fear adverse outcomes from their eating disorder on the pregnancy—this can lead to a time-limited remission. Other patients may develop a recurrence or worsening of their disorder because of anxiety and a fear of loss of control provoked by the weight gain, food cravings and food aversions associated with pregnancy.
Usually people with a history of bulimia nervosa have a sufficient diet during pregnancy and do not significantly differ in their nutrient intake and dietary supplement use compared to females without an eating disorder. They are more likely to be diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia.
Other than increased fetal mortality rates, the literature about the association between bulimia nervosa and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are mixed and inconsistent. The finding that is most often replicated is that bulimia nervosa is associated with increased rates of miscarriages. Other adverse outcomes reported include:
The treatment of bulimia nervosa during pregnancy follows the same principles as for a nonpregnant patient, see Principles of managing bulimia nervosa. Patients should be treated by a multidisciplinary team involving an obstetrician, psychiatrist (or a specialist eating disorder service), dietitian and physician. Depending on the patient’s baseline symptoms, weight and medical status, the patient and fetus may require more frequent monitoring than usual, using blood tests (to detect anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbance and nutritional deficiencies) and ultrasounds (to monitor fetal growth). If this is not possible, seek advice from their psychiatrist and a paediatrician.
For advice on psychotropic use during pregnancy, see here.

Considerations in managing bulimia nervosa in the postpartum
In the postpartum, the principles of treating patients with bulimia nervosa are the same as at any other time. Mothers with bulimia nervosa are:
Parent–infant interactions tend to involve more control and conflict, and parents can project their distorted body image onto their children. Children of mothers with bulimia nervosa tend to underweight for their age. Ongoing monitoring and management into the perinatal period is essential for both parent and infant.
For advice on psychotropic use while breastfeeding, see here.

Psychological treatment for bulimia nervosa
Use psychological therapies initially for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Specific training and protocols are required for psychological therapies for eating disorders; only a healthcare professional with appropriate expertise in the management of eating disorders (usually a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or occupational therapist) can deliver psychological treatment to a person with bulimia nervosa.
If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is present, refer to recommendations for the disorder and manage it concurrently. Substance abuse and deliberate self-harm need to be addressed first to enable a person with bulimia nervosa to engage in therapy.
For children and adolescents, bulimia nervosa-focused family therapy (ie family-based therapy modified for bulimia nervosa) is recommended. However, focal psychodynamic psychotherapy (FPT) or transdiagnostic enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-E) adapted for young people may also be used.
For adults with bulimia nervosa, an individual psychological therapy such as CBT-E or its parent therapy, CBT for bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN) is most effective.
Some adults with bulimia nervosa can find CBT to be unnecessarily intensive, or insufficient. In these instances, other psychological therapies may be used. See Table 8.12 for a list of psychological therapies for patients suffering from bulimia nervosa.
Therapy [NB1]
Targets
Tools
transdiagnostic enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-E) and cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN)
eating habits and weight control behaviours
preoccupation with body shape and weight
education about nutrition, shape and weight issues, and important complications with purging behaviours (eg hypokalaemia)
encouraging daily self-monitoring of relevant disorder-related thoughts and behaviours
information about a suitable eating pattern and the harms of restrictive dieting
gradual introduction of avoided foods into the patient’s diet
cognitive restructuring procedures to identify and challenge problematic thoughts and attitudes
relapse prevention strategies.
focal psychodynamic psychotherapy (FPT)
intra- and interpersonal maintaining factors (eg low self-esteem)
exploration of beliefs or schema
interpersonal therapy
goal setting
new behaviours
dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)
the dialectic of 2 opposing views of eating disorder behaviours
distress intolerance and use of binge eating and weight control behaviours to reduce distress
training in emotion regulation skills (mindfulness)
‘meaning making’ as acceptance and change
validating the worth of the individual
interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
interpersonal problem areas (eg grief, role transitions, role disputes, interpersonal deficits)
exploration of interpersonal function
encouraging affect
clarification
communication analysis
therapeutic relationships
If barriers to psychological therapies exist for patients with bulimia nervosa, guided cognitive behavioural self-help, where clinicians support patients in following a self-help program or manual, are effective. Unguided self-help may also be effective, but has been shown to have poorer outcomes than guided self-help. There are several suitable self-help books and websites available for use by both the patient and their clinician (see Principles of managing bulimia nervosa).

Pharmacological treatment for bulimia nervosa in adults and young people
Pharmacological treatment can be used for the management of bulimia nervosa in patients who have a limited or no response to psychological treatment alone, or where there is difficulty in accessing treatment. Pharmacological treatment with an antidepressant can be used adjunctively in patients with a comorbid mood disorder (eg major depression).
In choosing pharmacological treatment, consider the harm–benefit profile of the drug, in particular the:
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), particularly fluoxetine, have the strongest evidence for use in patients with bulimia nervosa; there is some evidence for citalopram, fluvoxamine and sertraline. SSRIs modify eating behaviours through serotonin-mediated effects on satiety, and have a beneficial effect on mood. Fluvoxamine and sertraline have a lower risk of QT-interval prolongation than fluoxetine and citalopram, they may be preferred in patients at risk of hypokalaemia and cardiac arrythmias. However, the long-term efficacy has not been established and the optimal duration of therapy is unknown—regular review of pharmacological treatment every 3 to 6 months is recommended.
For pharmacological treatment of bulimia nervosa in adults and young people, use:
There is a small evidence base for the use of topiramate for bulimia nervosa, and it may be used by specialists for patients who have not responded to treatment with other agents. Topiramate should not be used in patients who are underweight because it is associated with weight loss."
challenging-behaviour-autism-spectrum-disorder,"Challenging behaviour in children with autism spectrum disorder
Some children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will exhibit challenging behaviours, sometimes referred to as behaviours of concern or behaviours that challenge.
Challenging behaviour can be defined as any behaviour that:
Challenging behaviour can take a variety of forms, and be either:
Challenging behaviour in a child with autism spectrum disorder occurs on a spectrum of severity, ranging from noncompliance and self-stimulatory behaviours (eg rocking or engaging in certain rituals) to more severe behaviours (eg extreme aggression, hurting themselves) that require immediate intervention.
Challenging behaviour in a child with autism spectrum disorder may be acute or longstanding. It is often best understood to be a means by which the child, intentionally or unintentionally, is communicating something that is important for them in the best way they can with the skills that they have (eg pain, discomfort, distress, expressing a need for something). These circumstances can be accentuated for a child who is unable to communicate using spoken language; see also Communicating with a person with developmental disability. Challenging behaviour may manifest differently depending on the child’s age and ability to respond to change.
When managing challenging behaviour in a child with autism spectrum disorder:
Behaviour support for a child with autism spectrum disorder requires a multidisciplinary approach to properly assess the behaviour and implement a comprehensive management approach, including:
In conjunction with a comprehensive multidisciplinary management approach, pharmacotherapy may be considered by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children (eg child psychiatrist, paediatrician, general practitioner). Use of an antipsychotic for challenging behaviour in a child with autism spectrum disorder may improve the behaviour by reducing excitation and aggression; however, antipsychotic use in children has:
Risperidone and aripiprazole have the most evidence of efficacy for challenging behaviour in children with autism spectrum disorder. Although aripiprazole has similar clinical efficacy to risperidone, there is less trial data to support its use—aripiprazole has been shown to be effective in treating irritability in children with autism spectrum disorder in several open-label studies and placebo-controlled trials [Note 1].
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of other antipsychotics for challenging behaviour in children with autism spectrum disorder. Quetiapine is sometimes used if risperidone or aripiprazole are not suitable or available, but evidence is limited to open-label trials. Chlorpromazine, haloperidol and periciazine have very limited efficacy and safety data for the treatment of children with severe behavioural disturbances and are rarely used.
Discuss the following with the child, and their family or carers so they can make an informed decision about antipsychotic use:
If antipsychotic therapy is agreed upon, perform baseline tests to guide antipsychotic choice and to give a reference point for future monitoring. For a schedule for monitoring antipsychotic adverse effects, see here. Antipsychotics should be used as a time-limited trial with periodic review every 3 to 6 months to assess efficacy and determine whether treatment should be continued.
A clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children may consider using an antipsychotic for challenging behaviour in a child with autism spectrum disorder. A suitable regimen is:"
delayed-sleep-wake-disorder,"Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder
Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder is a circadian rhythm disorder in which sleep onset is persistently at least 2 hours later than desired, resulting in reduced sleep time, trouble waking when required, and daytime sleepiness and dysfunction. As such, the disorder can be misdiagnosed as initial insomnia. People with late chronotypes (‘night owls’) who do not experience daytime sequelae are not considered to have delayed sleep–wake phase disorder.
Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder affects 2 to 8% of the population and is most prevalent among young adults and adolescents—pubertal development causes a natural phase delay. People with delayed sleep–wake phase disorder often have comorbid psychiatric disorders (eg depression, substance abuse, anxiety) or psychosocial problems.
Assess delayed sleep–wake phase disorder with a sleep diary. People with sleep–wake phase disorders tend to sleep less on weekdays, but receive sufficient sleep when sleep is not restricted (eg on weekends or holidays). Formal actigraphy can assist with the diagnosis of delayed sleep–wake phase disorder.
If a persistent delay in sleep onset causes daytime sleepiness and dysfunction, treat delayed sleep–wake phase disorder by encouraging good sleep practices and, use the following steps to slowly adjust the circadian rhythm to a sleep–wake routine that provides sufficient sleep:
For adults with delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, combining the practices above with immediate-release melatonin can improve sleep duration, assist phase shift and reduce daytime sequelae [Note 1]. Immediate-release melatonin is not registered in Australia, but is available via the Special Access Scheme and from compounding pharmacies. A reasonable regimen is:
Avoid over-the-counter and internet-sourced melatonin formulations because the melatonin content in these preparations is unreliable. If a suitable immediate-release formulation of melatonin is not available, the modified-release formulation, which is registered in Australia for insomnia in adults aged 55 years or older, may be considered; however, it does not have evidence to support its use or to guide administration time for delayed sleep–wake phase disorder.
Once the desired sleep–wake routine is achieved, advise the patient to maintain it by continuing good sleep practices.
If the above recommendations are not successful, refer the patient to a sleep expert, and in the case of children, a paediatrician."
delirium,"Introduction to delirium
Delirium is an acute deterioration of mental state characterised by fluctuating symptoms of impaired attention, cognition and consciousness, typically developing over hours to days.
There are 3 types of delirium:
Delirium can cause the patient and their family, carers or significant others significant distress. In addition, compared to a patient of the same age, a patient with delirium is more likely to:
Delirium can be prevented—it is imperative to identify patients at risk of delirium to instigate preventive measures.
One of the key principles of managing delirium is to identify and treat its cause, yet delirium is frequently underdiagnosed. Although, at the time of writing, no trials have been undertaken to determine whether screening for delirium improves outcomes, screening combined with evidence-based prevention strategies, is a pragmatic, reasonable approach. Australian healthcare services are required to undertake cognitive screening in adults with one or more of the following delirium risk factors:
For further information, see the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) Delirium Clinical Care Standard.
Delirium has been mostly studied in acute hospital settings including critical care. Although it is unclear whether data from acute hospital settings are relevant to patients in other settings (eg residential aged-care facilities, where the prevalence of delirium is high), it is necessary to extrapolate data to this patient group because research is limited.
Management of children with delirium is beyond the scope of these guidelines—seek expert advice.

Risk factors for delirium in adults
Delirium is often triggered by one or more precipitating risk factors. Although delirium commonly occurs in an adult with one or more predisposing risk factors, it can be triggered by a significant event in a person without predisposing risk factors (eg a young adult who is critically unwell). The more predisposing factors present, the fewer precipitating factors needed to trigger delirium. The exact pathophysiology of this triggering process is complex and not well understood; however, assessing and treating these causes is a key part of managing delirium.
Predisposing risk factors for delirium include:
The most commonly reported precipitants of delirium include:
Drugs and drug groups commonly implicated in delirium are:
Drugs and drug groups with significant anticholinergic effects are:

Preventing delirium in adults
If an adult is at risk of delirium, regularly monitor them for signs of delirium (ie changes in behaviour, cognition and physical condition) and instigate a multicomponent preventive strategy, personalised to their needs and setting. As appropriate, this strategy should include:
At the time of writing, there is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend any drug (eg antipsychotics, melatonin, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) to prevent delirium [Note 2].

Diagnosing delirium in adults
Seek information about changes in the patient’s cognition and behaviour from a reliable source—if this is not the patient (eg the patient has dementia), ask their significant other or carer.
Tools to identify adults with acutely altered cognition include the:
Consider whether another condition could explain the patient’s change in mental state (eg dementia, depression, psychosis).
If delirium is suspected, undertake further assessment.
A history taken from a reliable source (eg significant other or carer) and physical examination may reveal delirium (see Evaluating mental state) and its likely precipitant.
Comprehensively review the patient’s drug history and consider stopping drugs that could be causing or contributing to delirium. Many patients recover without specific treatment once causative drugs are stopped.
The following investigations can assist in determining the cause(s) of delirium:
If a specific cause is suspected, consider other investigations as indicated; for example:
If a urinary tract infection is suspected to be the cause of delirium in an aged-care facility resident, see Figure 2.13 for assessment and management.
Delirium can be a response to several concurrent insults to brain functioning, without a single main cause. In some cases, no clear cause can be identified.

Managing delirium in adults
Ideally, prevent delirium, but if it occurs, the key principles of management are to identify and treat the cause(s), and start nonpharmacological management, including measures to prevent delirium, as soon as possible.
If a patient has a substitute decision-maker, keep them informed of the patient’s status and discuss management strategies with them—see also Informed consent.
A patient with delirium must be nursed in a quiet setting where they can be continuously observed—their behaviour may be unpredictable.
Approach a patient with delirium from the front, not the side—peripheral stimuli are more likely to be misinterpreted as hostile. Talk clearly and calmly and frequently orientate them (eg address them by name, explain the date and time, their location and your and other staff members’ roles and your purpose for approaching them). The patient is likely to be more settled in the presence of a familiar person (eg relative, friend, regular nursing staff member).
At minimum, review a patient with delirium daily.
Patients with delirium can accidentally harm themselves by pulling out medical lines and tubes (eg endotracheal tubes, intravascular and urinary catheters). If possible, remove these devices—this is usually more effective than trying to restrain the patient to avoid removal.
Delirium can deteriorate—be alert to signs of increasing agitation (eg persistently wanting to get out of bed and walk around). If nonpharmacological interventions have not calmed the patient:
Only use physical restraint as a last resort—it usually adds to the patient’s distress and disorientation, and can cause harm. If physical restraint cannot be avoided, see here for advice.
Explain to the patient and their significant other(s), the nature of delirium and potential reasons for unusual behaviour to reduce distress. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare (ACSQHC) Delirium Clinical Care Standard - Consumer fact sheet is a useful source of information.
Follow up patients with delirium.
For management of delirium:
If cause(s) of delirium are promptly addressed and nonpharmacological measures instigated (see Principles of managing delirium), drugs are not required for most patients.
Box 8.22 summarises the approach to using a drug to manage delirium in an adult.
No drug is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to treat delirium. Although antipsychotics are commonly used to manage delirium, high-quality evidence demonstrating effectiveness is unavailable. Systematic reviews of low-quality data suggest that antipsychotics do not reduce mortality, length of hospital stay, or delirium severity or duration, and do not improve cognitive function. Additionally, antipsychotics have significant adverse effects, including aggravation of delirium.
Nevertheless, clinical experience indicates that it may be reasonable to use an antipsychotic (combined with the other management strategies) if an adult with delirium is significantly distressed, or considered a threat to themselves or others—see Antipsychotic regimens for delirium.
Avoid using benzodiazepines for delirium, except when delirium is related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, or seizures. Benzodiazepines increase delirium risk and adverse effects are common.
Avoid using a psychotropic to manage delirium—address its cause(s) and use nonpharmacological interventions first.
If a psychotropic is required because the patient is significantly distressed, or considered a threat to themselves or others, administer an antipsychotic orally, if possible [NB1].
A single dose of an antipsychotic is usually adequate.
Avoid using benzodiazepines except for delirium caused by alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, or seizures.
If a psychotropic is used, still address the cause(s) of delirium and use nonpharmacological interventions.
Monitor the patient’s vital signs during and after administering an antipsychotic.
Avoid using ‘as needed’ (prn) psychotropic orders. If these cannot be avoided, clearly specify both the indication for administration and the maximum dose per 24 hours—review the patient and the use of the ‘as needed’ psychotropic daily.
Keep a record of drugs given to the patient and ensure this record accompanies the patient if they are moved to another location.
If the cause of the delirium is unknown and could be caused by alcohol withdrawal, consider starting thiamine; see regimen here.
Despite the limitations of antipsychotic therapy, consider using the regimens below for an adult with delirium if they are significantly distressed, or considered a threat to themselves or others, and addressing the cause(s) of delirium and using nonpharmacological measures have not calmed them.
For adults with delirium who do not have Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, use:
Haloperidol (in particular) and olanzapine and risperidone can aggravate motor features in Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies.
For adults with delirium who have Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, use [Note 7]:
If oral administration is not possible for adults with delirium who do not have Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, use:
If oral administration is not possible for adults with delirium who have Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, seek expert advice.
A single dose of an antipsychotic is usually adequate to manage hyperactive delirium. The onset of action for the above antipsychotics can be delayed by 30 to 60 minutes—do not give a second dose for at least 30 minutes. Antipsychotics are slowly eliminated and repeat doses can have cumulative effects. If further doses are required, review the diagnosis and management plan. In particular, optimise nonpharmacological measures (see Principles of managing delirium in adults). A short course (eg 48 to 72 hours) of regular low-dose antipsychotic therapy may be appropriate for patients who initially respond to an antipsychotic but experience persistent severe distress—stop the antipsychotic as soon as possible. Ongoing delirium can be an antipsychotic adverse effect.
After antipsychotic administration, gently encourage the patient to walk around a safe space. Minimise threatening stimuli and ensure staff maintain a respectful distance to reduce the risk of exacerbating the patient’s agitation.
Monitor the patient’s vital signs during and after administering the antipsychotic.
Intravenous therapy is rarely required for patients with delirium and should be avoided. For advice on managing a patient who poses an immediate threat to themselves or others, and requires immediate sedation, see here for adults and here for older people.

Ideally, prevent delirium, but if it occurs, the key principles of management are to identify and treat the cause(s), and start nonpharmacological management, including measures to prevent delirium, as soon as possible.
If a patient has a substitute decision-maker, keep them informed of the patient’s status and discuss management strategies with them—see also Informed consent.
A patient with delirium must be nursed in a quiet setting where they can be continuously observed—their behaviour may be unpredictable.
Approach a patient with delirium from the front, not the side—peripheral stimuli are more likely to be misinterpreted as hostile. Talk clearly and calmly and frequently orientate them (eg address them by name, explain the date and time, their location and your and other staff members’ roles and your purpose for approaching them). The patient is likely to be more settled in the presence of a familiar person (eg relative, friend, regular nursing staff member).
At minimum, review a patient with delirium daily.
Patients with delirium can accidentally harm themselves by pulling out medical lines and tubes (eg endotracheal tubes, intravascular and urinary catheters). If possible, remove these devices—this is usually more effective than trying to restrain the patient to avoid removal.
Delirium can deteriorate—be alert to signs of increasing agitation (eg persistently wanting to get out of bed and walk around). If nonpharmacological interventions have not calmed the patient:
Only use physical restraint as a last resort—it usually adds to the patient’s distress and disorientation, and can cause harm. If physical restraint cannot be avoided, see here for advice.
Explain to the patient and their significant other(s), the nature of delirium and potential reasons for unusual behaviour to reduce distress. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare (ACSQHC) Delirium Clinical Care Standard - Consumer fact sheet is a useful source of information.
Follow up patients with delirium.
For management of delirium:

If cause(s) of delirium are promptly addressed and nonpharmacological measures instigated (see Principles of managing delirium), drugs are not required for most patients.
Box 8.22 summarises the approach to using a drug to manage delirium in an adult.
No drug is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to treat delirium. Although antipsychotics are commonly used to manage delirium, high-quality evidence demonstrating effectiveness is unavailable. Systematic reviews of low-quality data suggest that antipsychotics do not reduce mortality, length of hospital stay, or delirium severity or duration, and do not improve cognitive function. Additionally, antipsychotics have significant adverse effects, including aggravation of delirium.
Nevertheless, clinical experience indicates that it may be reasonable to use an antipsychotic (combined with the other management strategies) if an adult with delirium is significantly distressed, or considered a threat to themselves or others—see Antipsychotic regimens for delirium.
Avoid using benzodiazepines for delirium, except when delirium is related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, or seizures. Benzodiazepines increase delirium risk and adverse effects are common.
Avoid using a psychotropic to manage delirium—address its cause(s) and use nonpharmacological interventions first.
If a psychotropic is required because the patient is significantly distressed, or considered a threat to themselves or others, administer an antipsychotic orally, if possible [NB1].
A single dose of an antipsychotic is usually adequate.
Avoid using benzodiazepines except for delirium caused by alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, or seizures.
If a psychotropic is used, still address the cause(s) of delirium and use nonpharmacological interventions.
Monitor the patient’s vital signs during and after administering an antipsychotic.
Avoid using ‘as needed’ (prn) psychotropic orders. If these cannot be avoided, clearly specify both the indication for administration and the maximum dose per 24 hours—review the patient and the use of the ‘as needed’ psychotropic daily.
Keep a record of drugs given to the patient and ensure this record accompanies the patient if they are moved to another location.
If the cause of the delirium is unknown and could be caused by alcohol withdrawal, consider starting thiamine; see regimen here.
Despite the limitations of antipsychotic therapy, consider using the regimens below for an adult with delirium if they are significantly distressed, or considered a threat to themselves or others, and addressing the cause(s) of delirium and using nonpharmacological measures have not calmed them.

Following up an adult with delirium
At minimum, review a patient with delirium daily. If delirium does not resolve within a week, review the suspected cause(s) and treatment. Consider alternative diagnoses, and whether further investigation is required. Consider whether the patient could have dementia, especially dementia with Lewy bodies, and whether the symptoms of delirium and dementia are overlapping. Optimising nonpharmacological interventions (see Principles of managing delirium in adults) may improve symptoms of delirium.
Delirium is not always transient; almost half of patients with delirium in hospital do not completely recover before discharge. Close liaison between the hospital and other care providers (eg general practitioner, residential care staff) at the time of discharge is essential, as is ongoing vigilance about drugs that can impair cognition, environmental changes and sensory problems—see Preventing delirium and Principles of managing delirium.
Patients who have experienced delirium are often troubled by frightening memories or misconceptions about their time in hospital. Explain the nature of delirium and reassure them to reduce distress."
delusional-disorder,"Delusional disorder
Delusional disorder usually presents in middle to late life. It is characterised by delusions (grandiose, persecutory, erotomanic, somatic) lasting for at least 1 month and resulting in functional decline. Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent. If a first episode of delusional disorder is suspected, see Assessing a first episode of psychosis in adults and young people.
Treatment of delusional disorder is long term and multifaceted. For initial treatment, see Principles of treating a first episode of psychosis in adults and young people."
dementia,"Introduction to dementia
Dementia is a life-limiting, progressive syndrome characterised by cognitive and functional decline. People with dementia experience behavioural change and noncognitive symptoms known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, or changed or challenging behaviour of dementia, which can significantly affect them and their significant other(s) and carers.
Dementia has many causes, most of which are neurodegenerative diseases (eg Alzheimer disease)—see Dementia subtypes. Although dementia can occur in people younger than 65 years, increasing age is the most significant risk factor for the commonest forms of dementia; one in 10 Australians aged 65 years or older has dementia.
No definitive measures exist to prevent dementia—although addressing modifiable factors may reduce its risk.
Regardless of the type or severity of dementia, its management involves supporting and collaborating with the patient, and their significant others or carers, to meet their needs and goals.

Reducing the risk of dementia
The ‘Dementia prevention, intervention, and care: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission’ [Note 1] identified 12 potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia—addressing these factors may prevent or delay dementia:
Furthermore, addressing these risk factors can prevent other chronic diseases (eg smoking, poor nutrition and inadequate physical activity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease).
Box 8.23 lists practices that people can incorporate into their lives to reduce their risk of dementia and can be printed as a handout.
Reduce alcohol intake
Remain cognitively and socially active [NB3]
Eat a healthy diet [NB4]
Protect the head from injury (eg wear a helmet when cycling)
Prevent hearing loss (eg wear high-quality earplugs or ear muffs when exposed to loud noise) [NB5]
Regularly undertake physical activity [NB6]
Practice good sleep hygiene
Avoid or stop smoking and avoid second-hand smoke exposure
Maintain a healthy weight.
Despite a considerable amount of research, no drug, or herbal or dietary supplement has been shown to prevent dementia or cognitive impairment. Some studies have shown higher rates of adverse effects with drugs trialled to prevent dementia (eg hormone replacement therapy, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) than placebo. Consequently, do not prescribe drugs, or herbal or dietary supplements to prevent dementia or cognitive impairment.
The use of benzodiazepines or drugs with anticholinergic properties in later life may increase the risk of dementia—avoid prescribing these drugs and, if people take them, discuss deprescribing. For advice on deprescribing benzodiazepines used for insomnia, see here, or anxiety, see here.

Diagnosing dementia
Dementia is diagnosed when cognitive decline affects a patient’s ability to function independently and reversible causes (eg delirium or depression [Note 2]) have been excluded. Components of diagnosis include:
If dementia is suspected, undertake further assessment and offer referral to memory assessment specialists or services, for example aged-care assessment teams can assist with further evaluation, future care planning and implementing support services.
Discuss the diagnosis and prognosis with the patient and their significant other(s) with sensitivity and empathy; for advice on discussing bad news, see here. At the time of diagnosis, provide the patient with information about dementia, support and services; encourage them to visit the Dementia Australia website or contact the National Dementia Helpline (1800 100 500).
Some causes of cognitive impairment are reversible and should be excluded before a diagnosis of dementia is made. Assess:
If the patient is at risk of a sexually transmitted infection, also order syphilis serology and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody/antigen testing. Symptoms may be due to neurosyphilis or dementia may be associated with HIV.
Unless there is a clear diagnosis of moderate to severe dementia, also request cerebral imaging (eg computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], positron emission tomography [PET]) to exclude other neurological pathologies (eg cerebral space occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus) and determine dementia subtype.
Although biomarkers (eg cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] beta-amyloid or tau) appear promising, at the time of writing, their role in the diagnosis of dementia remains unclear.
A variety of cognitive tests are available to appraise cognitive function. However, none can confirm or exclude dementia without comprehensive assessment. Most tests have been developed for Alzheimer disease and do not perform as well for other types of dementia—see Dementia subtypes [Note 5]. Choice of cognitive test depends on patient factors (eg cultural and linguistic background, motor and verbal skills, age, vision, education level, intelligence), setting, and clinician training and experience. For commonly used tools for cognitive testing in Australia, see Box 8.24.

Assessing a patient with dementia
Assessing a patient with dementia includes determining the dementia subtype and severity, and assessing for behavioural and psychological symptoms to:
Many patients with dementia fail to present to a doctor for treatable conditions. For newly diagnosed patients or those entering residential aged-care facilities, undertake a comprehensive assessment. This includes:
For advice on the regular care of a patient with dementia, see Table 8.7.
The common causes of dementia are Alzheimer disease (50 to 75% of cases), vascular dementia (20 to 30%), frontotemporal dementias (up to 10%), and dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia (up to 10%). Many patients have more than one subtype of dementia (mixed dementia); the most common combination is Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Less common causes include infections (eg human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), hazardous alcohol consumption (a significant cause of dementia arising before the age of 65), Huntington disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and traumatic brain injury.
Dementia subtypes are diagnosed on the basis of early clinical features, patterns of disease progression, and behavioural and psychological features. These diagnoses are probable rather than definite because clinical features of a specific pathology widely vary—cerebral imaging can assist with diagnosis. If possible, seek diagnostic advice from a specialist if a dementia subtype other than Alzheimer disease is suspected. Box 8.25 lists typical features of common dementia subtypes.
Memory impairment is prominent early in Alzheimer dementia. As dementia slowly progresses, memory declines further and other symptoms become more prominent, including executive function impairment [NB3].
In dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, memory is often initially maintained but deteriorates as dementia slowly progresses. Both dementias are associated with impaired executive function [NB3] and have a gradual, progressive decline with visual hallucinations, fluctuations in arousal and attention, or parkinsonism. REM sleep behaviour disorder often precedes both dementias.
Although features, onset and progression of frontotemporal dementia vary, memory often only deteriorates as dementia progresses. Prominent early symptoms include personality and behavioural changes, and language problems.
Vascular dementia can have a sudden onset (following stroke) or manifest with progressive or stepwise cognitive decline. Symptomatology depends on the nature and location of cerebrovascular disease, but impaired executive function is common [NB3].
The Mini-mental State Examination [MMSE] and Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE]) are moderately correlated with functional impairment in Alzheimer disease and have been used to assess its severity in drug trials. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) uses these tests to determine Alzheimer disease severity. A MMSE score between 21 and 24 (out of 30) is generally accepted to indicate mild Alzheimer disease, a score between 10 and 20 indicates moderate Alzheimer disease and a score less than 10 indicates severe Alzheimer disease.
The MMSE and SMMSE have limited real-world applications. Some patients (eg those with intellectual disabilities, poor education level, illiteracy, innumeracy, sensory impairments, or those from linguistically or culturally diverse backgrounds) may be unable to take these tests or record a misleadingly low result. Although the MMSE and SMMSE are suitable to assess Alzheimer disease, they are not suitable to assess most other types of dementia because they primarily assess cognition (executive function is not adequately tested).
In practice, dementia severity is based on the impact of functional and cognitive impairment, behavioural and psychological symptoms, and previous cognitive functioning. For example, a person with early frontotemporal dementia who has limited cognitive impairment (eg a MMSE score of 24) but significant behavioural problems necessitating institutional care would be considered to have severe dementia. Whereas, a patient with early Alzheimer disease who has limited education may appear to have significant cognitive impairment on testing (eg a MMSE score of 13), but may not be functionally impaired and would be considered to have mild dementia.
Over 90% of patients with dementia will experience behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms can have a significant effect on the patient and their family, carers or significant others, and precipitate entry into residential aged care—see Box 8.26 for examples of BPSD.
Delusions—distressing beliefs [NB1]
Hallucinations [NB1]
Agitation—easily upset, repeating questions, arguing or complaining, hoarding, pacing, inappropriate screaming, crying out or disruptive sounds, rejection of care (eg bathing, dressing, grooming), leaving home
Aggression—physical or verbal
Depression or dysphoria
Anxiety—worrying, shadowing (ie following carer)
Apathy or indifference
Disinhibition—socially or sexually inappropriate behaviour
Irritability or lability
Motor disturbance—repetitive activities without purpose (eg wandering, rummaging)
Night-time behaviours—waking and getting up at night
Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are multifactorial, often arising or worsening as dementia progresses and the patient loses the ability to communicate. Before starting treatment for a behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia, address factors that could precipitate the behaviour, see Box 8.27.
Try to understand the behaviour in the context of the patient’s life story (including cultural, religious or social norms) and personality—seek information from people familiar with the patient before and while affected by dementia.
Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are often temporary. Carefully analyse and record the cause, frequency, severity and timing of the behaviour. The Dementia Outcomes Measurement Suite [URL] has a comprehensive list of tools to assess behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
Create a plan to prevent and manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia with the patient and their significant other(s) and/or carer(s).
For advice on assessing depressive symptoms in dementia, see here.
Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service (DBMAS) has a 24-hour helpline (1800 699 799) that provides expert advice and support to staff and carers of people with challenging behaviour of dementia in the community and in acute, primary care or residential aged-care settings.
If behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia place the patient or others at risk of harm, see Nonpharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and Pharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.

Approach to managing dementia
The approach to managing dementia is primarily supportive and nonpharmacological. Table 8.7 provides a framework to collaborate with the patient and their significant others (or carers) to provide holistic patient-centred care by identifying and addressing goals and requirements.
Care target
Intervention
Ensure the patient understands their dementia diagnosis
Provide the patient with as much information as they wish to know about dementia; encourage them to visit the Dementia Australia website or contact the National Dementia Helpline 1800 100 500 for advice including information about support and services.
Reduce the impact of cognitive and functional decline on day-to-day life [NB3]
Determine and address the patient’s unmet needs (eg organise additional help with personal care or more complex activities of daily living).
Adapt the patient’s environment to their needs and consider changes to assist them to live at home as long as possible.
Encourage the patient to engage in activities that promote functional independence and involve their family, carers or significant others if possible.
Assess whether the patient takes their drugs properly and offer them medication aids (eg webster packs), if appropriate.
Consider whether any drugs could be causing cognitive impairment (eg anticholinergics, psychotropics [especially benzodiazepines]) and consider deprescribing them—see Review and rationalise drugs [NB4].
Review driving ability and report to relevant authorities according to regulations [NB5]. Most patients with dementia lose the capacity to safely drive within a few years of diagnosis—plan alternative transport options with the patient and their significant other or carer.
Prevent and/or address behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [NB3]
Create and use a personalised multicomponent behavioural care plan that involves assessing potential triggers and optimising nonpharmacological interventions in the context of the person’s life story (including cultural, religious or social norms) and personality.
Avoid using physical restraint to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia—it usually adds to the patient’s distress and disorientation.
Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service (DBMAS) has a 24-hour helpline (1800 699 799) that provides expert advice and support to staff and carers of people with challenging behaviour of dementia in the community and in acute, primary care or residential aged-care settings.
Promote general health and wellbeing
Monitor and treat medical and psychiatric comorbidities of a person with dementia.
Promote general health and wellbeing by supporting a person with dementia to:
Review and rationalise drugs [NB3]
Regularly review the patient’s drug regimen—aim to reduce polypharmacy and administrative burden. Check if each drug:
Consider deprescribing the drug if it does not meet the above criteria—see also Box 10.18 and Impact of deprescribing on a patient and their family [NB4].
Plan for the future
Determine whether the patient has an advance care plan and has appointed a substitute decision-maker for when they lose their decision-making capacity. If they do not have an advance care plan or substitute decision-maker, encourage and support them to start planning; see here for advice.
Consider and plan for residential aged care.
Support family, carers or significant others
Support family, carers or significant others and provide them with information about dementia.
Care at end of life
For advice on managing dementia at the end of life, see End-stage dementia.
The role of drugs in the management of dementia is limited.
Pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment is palliative—acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can temporarily improve or stabilise symptoms of some types of dementia, but are not curative and do not modify disease progression.
Pharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia is only indicated if either:
If a drug is used to treat behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, it should not be used as a sole intervention, but as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
Other drugs (eg statins, antihypertensives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and herbal (eg ginkgo biloba, ginseng) and dietary supplements (eg omega-3 fatty acids, nutritional drinks, vitamin D, vitamin E) do not have a role in the management of dementia. Studies have failed to show clinically significant improvements. Avoid vitamin E—it has been associated with an increase in mortality.

Supporting families, carers or significant others of people with dementia
Support family members, significant others or carers of a person with dementia—educate them about dementia and the nature of cognitive and behavioural abnormalities. The impact of caring for a person with dementia can be significant and increases the risk of carer depression and anxiety.
Useful resources for families, carers and significant others of people with dementia include:

Pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment in dementia
Pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment is only one aspect of caring for people with dementia; see Approach to managing dementia for the mainstays of treatment.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ie donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine (an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA]) can modestly improve or stabilise symptoms of some types of dementia, but are not curative and do not delay disease progression. These drugs are only approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for Alzheimer dementia.
For advice on pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment in:
Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine for people with frontotemporal dementia.
Seek expert advice on pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment associated with other forms of dementia.
Drug treatments for Alzheimer dementia are not curative and do not modify disease progression.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the drug class of choice for Alzheimer dementia; in the short term, they modestly improve or stabilise cognition, alertness and function. All acetylcholinesterase inhibitors appear to have similar efficacy for Alzheimer dementia. Their modest benefits must be weighed against their significant adverse effects, which include prominent gastrointestinal adverse effects (particularly nausea, vomiting and anorexia), weight loss, vivid dreams, urinary incontinence, tremor, cramps, bradycardia, dizziness and drowsiness. Because of these adverse effects, the benefit–harm profile of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors varies depending on patient factors. Before starting an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, perform an electrocardiogram (ECG), record the patient’s weight and assess their falls risk. Most adverse effects are dose-related; the regimens below aim to minimise adverse effects by starting treatment with a low dose and slowly increasing.
Donepezil, galantamine and the rivastigmine transdermal patch are easier to use than oral rivastigmine because they are dosed once daily and the dose can be more easily titrated. The rivastigmine transdermal patch is better tolerated than the oral formulation.
Memantine offers a small, short-term improvement or stabilisation in cognition and function for people with moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia (regardless of whether it is given as monotherapy or in combination with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor).
Before starting pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer dementia, discuss potential benefits and harms with the patient or their substitute decision maker—consider their goals of care and create a plan for when to stop therapy; see Modification and duration of pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment in dementia.
If an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is considered appropriate to treat cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer dementia and the patient has undergone an ECG, a falls risk assessment and had their baseline weight recorded, use:
If the response to an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is inadequate in a patient with moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia, consider adding memantine (as below). Also consider whether the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be continued—see Guide to modifying pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment in dementia.
If memantine is considered appropriate to treat cognitive impairment in a patient with moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia (eg a patient who cannot take an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), use:
Manage dementia with Lewy bodies in consultation with a specialist.
Drug treatments for dementia with Lewy bodies are not curative and do not modify disease progression.
The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil and rivastigmine, modestly improve or stabilise cognition, alertness and function, and reduce hallucination frequency. Donepezil and rivastigmine appear to have similar efficacy for dementia with Lewy bodies. Their modest benefits must be weighed against their significant adverse effects, which include prominent gastrointestinal adverse effects (particularly nausea, vomiting and anorexia), weight loss, vivid dreams, urinary incontinence, tremor, cramps, bradycardia, dizziness and drowsiness.

Donepezil and rivastigmine transdermal patches are easier to use than oral rivastigmine because they are dosed once daily and can be more easily titrated. The rivastigmine transdermal patch is better tolerated than the oral formulation.
Before starting pharmacotherapy for cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies, discuss potential benefits and harms with the patient or their substitute decision maker—consider their goals of care and create a plan for when to stop therapy (see Modification and duration of pharmacological therapy for cognitive impairment in dementia).
If an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is considered appropriate to treat cognitive symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies and the patient has undergone an ECG, a falls risk assessment and had their baseline weight recorded, use:
The evidence for memantine for dementia with Lewy bodies is equivocal. If a patient cannot take donepezil or rivastigmine, consider using the memantine regimen for Alzheimer dementia.
Within 1 month of starting an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine for dementia, assess the patient for adverse drug effects and adjust the dose or treatment accordingly; see also Table 8.8. Within 6 months (usually after 2 to 3 months of therapy at the maximum tolerated dose), and thereafter every 6 months:
Table 8.8 provides guidance on whether to maintain or adjust therapy.
If the patient tolerates and appears to benefit from an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, continue it for as long as quality of life is maintained—that is, until the patient has end-stage dementia (eg lost independent mobility, can no longer swallow) and therapy is no longer achieving their goals and preferences.
For advice on stopping an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, see here. Stopping these drugs can cause an irreversible or more rapid decline in function and cognition, and precipitate severe behavioural or psychological symptoms. However, this does not preclude stopping treatment at the request of the patient or their substitute decision-maker.

The following recommendations apply to the first year of treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and should be considered in conjunction with Table 8.8.
If the patient cannot tolerate one acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, they may be able to tolerate another—stop the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor associated with the adverse effect and only start the new one once the adverse effect has resolved.
If the patient does not respond or stops responding to one acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, they may respond to another—perform a direct switch (ie stop the original acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and start the new one the next day).
If criteria for switching are not met, but switching is still considered, seek specialist advice (eg geriatrician, psychiatrist, neurologist).
If the criteria for stopping an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine are not met, but deprescribing is considered, seek specialist advice (eg geriatrician, psychiatrist, neurologist).
If a criterion for stopping an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine is met, engage in shared decision making with the patient or their substitute decision-maker. Discuss:
If stopping an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, make a plan with the patient or their substitute decision-maker, the patient’s significant other(s) or carer(s), and other relevant healthcare professionals. The plan should set out an approach to monitoring, dosage adjustment and indicators for resuming the drug.
It is preferable to avoid abruptly stopping therapy—instead, slowly reduce the dosage and regularly assess the patient during the process to:
Halve the dosage every 4 weeks until the lowest dose possible is used for 4 weeks, then stop. If available formulations do not allow the dose to be halved, step down through available formulations. Adjust the speed of dosage reduction depending on the reason for stopping the drug (eg stop therapy immediately if the drug has caused a severe adverse effect) and patient response.
During dosage reduction, assess cognition, function, and behavioural and psychological symptoms at a minimum of every 4 weeks—more frequent monitoring may be required depending on the situation. Between assessments, the patient and/or their significant other(s) and/or carer(s) should watch for signs of deterioration and seek medical advice if symptoms worsen. If the patient deteriorates during dosage reduction or after the drug has been stopped, before attributing their symptoms to drug withdrawal, consider alternative causes (eg delirium).
If a severe withdrawal reaction (ie worsening agitation, aggression, hallucinations, reduced consciousness) occurs within a week of dosage reduction or stopping therapy, immediately resume therapy at the previous minimum effective dosage.
If cognition, function, or behavioural and psychological symptoms worsen after more than a week, but less than 6 weeks after dosage reduction or stopping therapy, it is likely symptoms that were previously treated by the drug are re-emerging. Consider resuming therapy at the previous minimum effective dose.
If cognition, function, or behavioural and psychological symptoms worsen after more than 6 weeks, but less than 3 months after dosage reduction or stopping therapy, this may due to be symptom re-emergence or natural dementia progression. Beyond 3 months, symptom worsening is usually due to dementia progression.

Nonpharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia
Based on patient assessment, create an individualised behavioural management plan considering the patient’s preferences and goals of care. If the patient is unable to participate in the planning, review their advance care management plan and consult with their substitute decision-maker.
Adapting the patient’s environment, routine and activity can assist in preventing and treating behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Consider whether respite care may help carer stress.
A graphic to support nonpharmacological management has been created by NPS MedicineWise and is available here. For comprehensive advice on nonpharmacological prevention and management of behavioural and psychological symptoms, see:
Avoid using physical restraint to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia—it usually adds to the patient’s distress and disorientation.
Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service (DBMAS) has a 24-hour helpline (1800 699 799) that provides:
If behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia place the patient or others at risk of harm, also see Pharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. Referral to the Specialist Dementia Care Program (SDCP) may be appropriate until symptoms have reduced or stabilised.

Pharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia
Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are often temporary and can usually be prevented and treated with nonpharmacological management. Communication abilities often decline as dementia progresses, and changed or challenging behaviour is often caused by unmet needs unlikely to be helped by drugs (eg need to toilet, distress from pain or loneliness, frustration). If behaviour is adequately assessed and its cause is promptly addressed, drugs are unnecessary for most patients with dementia who experience symptoms of agitation, aggression or psychosis.
Drugs used to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia appear to be less effective than nonpharmacological management. These limitations must be balanced against the serious harms associated with psychotropic use in people with dementia. Only consider using a drug to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia if nonpharmacological management has not alleviated symptoms and the patient is distressed or considered a threat to themselves or others. It is preferable to seek expert advice (eg from a specialist or a specialist centre [Note 9]) before starting a drug.
If a drug is used for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia:
If a drug appears to be ineffective, reassess behavioural and psychological symptoms and consider seeking expert advice—do not continue to trial drugs to manage the behaviour.
The evidence base to guide drug use for behavioural symptoms of dementia is mainly from common dementia subtypes (Alzheimer disease, mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, and to a lesser extent, dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia in Parkinson disease). Use caution before applying the advice below to other dementias (eg frontotemporal dementia).
Antipsychotics are the drug class of choice for agitation, aggression or psychotic symptoms of Alzheimer disease and mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia because they have the strongest evidence (although small) of benefit. Risperidone, olanzapine and, to a lesser extent, aripiprazole can modestly reduce these symptoms in a small proportion of patients. This modest efficacy must be balanced with a range of adverse effects, including further cognitive decline and an increased risk of death and cerebrovascular events. If the patient is at high risk of stroke (eg has poorly controlled vascular disease, atrial fibrillation or a history of stroke), avoid using an antipsychotic; undertake a benefit–harm analysis and if possible, seek expert advice.
For advice on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson disease, see here.
Patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies can experience severe sensitivity reactions and worsening of motor symptoms in response to antipsychotics. The drugs of choice for agitation, aggression or psychosis in these patients are rivastigmine or donepezil. There is insufficient evidence to guide antipsychotic therapy in dementia with Lewy bodies—use antipsychotic therapy with caution. If antipsychotic therapy is used, low-dose quetiapine is preferred because it may be less likely to cause the aforementioned adverse effects.
If an antipsychotic cannot be used or has been ineffective, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant may be considered for agitation or aggression (not psychosis) of dementia. However, the evidence base to support SSRIs for agitation and aggression of dementia is significantly weaker than for antipsychotics. Although antidepressants appear to be safer than antipsychotics (they are associated with significantly lower mortality rates), they are associated with other adverse effects including hyponatraemia and falls. Of all the SSRIs, citalopram has the strongest evidence for agitation and aggression of dementia—if it is used, monitor for adverse effects and review response to treatment at 2 to 3 months and consider stopping if effectiveness is limited.
Avoid using benzodiazepines to treat agitation, aggression and psychosis of dementia—there is limited evidence of benefit and they are associated with serious adverse effects including cognitive decline, urinary incontinence, falls, hip fractures and dependence [Note 10]. Benzodiazepine use has also been associated with increased all-cause mortality. If an antipsychotic or an antidepressant cannot be used, a benzodiazepine with a (comparatively) short half-life and no active metabolites (eg oxazepam) may be considered for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia for a maximum of 2 weeks—closely monitor the patient for adverse effects.
Other drugs have insufficient evidence to recommend their use for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia.
Do not use sodium valproate to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia. Limited evidence suggests it does not improve these symptoms and is associated with a higher rate of adverse effects, some of which are serious—a Cochrane review concluded that further research on sodium valproate for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia may not be justified [Note 11][Note 12].
If the patient poses an immediate threat to themselves or others and immediate tranquilisation is required with a parenterally administered drug, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults for advice.
If nonpharmacological management does not alleviate agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia and symptoms are distressing for the patient, or the patient is considered a threat to themselves or others, consider the benefit–harm profile of antipsychotic use for the patient; see here [Note 13].
If immediate intervention is not required, engage in shared decision making with the patient or their substitute decision-maker. Discuss:
If antipsychotic therapy is agreed upon, perform baseline tests to help guide antipsychotic choice.
If immediate intervention is required, as soon as practical, discuss antipsychotic therapy with the patient or their substitute decision-maker and perform baseline tests.
If an antipsychotic is considered necessary for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia that is not associated with Lewy bodies or Parkinson disease, use:
If aripiprazole is considered, seek expert advice on dosage.
For advice on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson disease, see here.
If an antipsychotic is considered necessary for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia associated with Lewy bodies (ie rivastigmine or donepezil is inadequate), use:
When an antipsychotic is used to treat a behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia, effectiveness will be evident within 2 weeks of starting therapy; during this time, review the target behaviour weekly and stop the antipsychotic if no benefit is seen [Note 14]. Also stop the antipsychotic if a problematic adverse effect occurs.
If the patient tolerates the antipsychotic and is experiencing an improvement in the target symptom, continue therapy and review response every 4 to 6 weeks. Also monitor for antipsychotic adverse effects according to the schedule set out here. If the patient is not receiving an obvious ongoing benefit or a problematic adverse effect occurs, stop the antipsychotic.
Avoid continuing an antipsychotic for longer than 12 weeks to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia because behavioural and psychological symptoms are often temporary.
If the antipsychotic is stopped within 12 weeks and the patient’s symptoms were not initially severe, the antipsychotic can be stopped abruptly. However, if the antipsychotic has been continued for 12 weeks or longer, or symptoms were initially severe, consider slowly reducing the antipsychotic dose to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects—a similar approach to that described in Deprescribing a long-term antipsychotic for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia may be used.
Patients taking an antipsychotic long term (for 12 weeks or longer) for a behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia (BPSD) can usually stop the antipsychotic without their symptom worsening. Rarely, patients will experience a worsening of symptoms if their symptoms were initially severe (eg psychotic features, violent aggression)—seek expert (eg psychiatrist, neurologist, geriatrician) advice before deprescribing. Patients whose symptoms were not initially severe can become less agitated when the antipsychotic is stopped.
If an antipsychotic has been used to treat behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia for 12 weeks or longer, begin deprescribing if:
Simultaneously engage in shared decision making with the patient or their substitute decision-maker and, if they consent , their family, carers or significant others. Discuss:
On the basis of these discussions, collaboratively develop a plan [Note 15] that sets out the approach to monitoring, dosage adjustment, optimising nonpharmacological management (which is especially important if symptoms re-emerge) and indicators for restarting an antipsychotic. Involve relevant healthcare professionals in the plan’s development.
Despite limited evidence that it is safe to abruptly stop an antipsychotic used long term for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, it may be preferable to slowly reduce the dosage to reduce the risk of behavioural symptoms worsening and antipsychotic withdrawal symptoms. Reduce the dose by 25 to 50% every 1 to 2 weeks until the lowest practical dose is reached, then after 1 to 2 weeks, stop the antipsychotic. Consider a slower dosage reduction schedule for patients who were taking a high dose of an antipsychotic or who had severe symptoms initially.
During dose reduction, assess target symptoms and monitor for withdrawal symptoms every 1 to 2 weeks (ie every time a dose reduction is made) or more frequently if the patient was taking a high dose of an antipsychotic or had severe symptoms initially. If target symptoms become significant or severe withdrawal adverse effects occur, consider restarting the antipsychotic at the minimum effective dose and re-trial deprescribing after 3 months.

If an antipsychotic is considered necessary for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia associated with Lewy bodies (ie rivastigmine or donepezil is inadequate), use:

When an antipsychotic is used to treat a behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia, effectiveness will be evident within 2 weeks of starting therapy; during this time, review the target behaviour weekly and stop the antipsychotic if no benefit is seen [Note 14]. Also stop the antipsychotic if a problematic adverse effect occurs.
If the patient tolerates the antipsychotic and is experiencing an improvement in the target symptom, continue therapy and review response every 4 to 6 weeks. Also monitor for antipsychotic adverse effects according to the schedule set out here. If the patient is not receiving an obvious ongoing benefit or a problematic adverse effect occurs, stop the antipsychotic.
Avoid continuing an antipsychotic for longer than 12 weeks to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia because behavioural and psychological symptoms are often temporary.
If the antipsychotic is stopped within 12 weeks and the patient’s symptoms were not initially severe, the antipsychotic can be stopped abruptly. However, if the antipsychotic has been continued for 12 weeks or longer, or symptoms were initially severe, consider slowly reducing the antipsychotic dose to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects—a similar approach to that described in Deprescribing a long-term antipsychotic for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia may be used.

Patients taking an antipsychotic long term (for 12 weeks or longer) for a behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia (BPSD) can usually stop the antipsychotic without their symptom worsening. Rarely, patients will experience a worsening of symptoms if their symptoms were initially severe (eg psychotic features, violent aggression)—seek expert (eg psychiatrist, neurologist, geriatrician) advice before deprescribing. Patients whose symptoms were not initially severe can become less agitated when the antipsychotic is stopped.
If an antipsychotic has been used to treat behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia for 12 weeks or longer, begin deprescribing if:
Simultaneously engage in shared decision making with the patient or their substitute decision-maker and, if they consent , their family, carers or significant others. Discuss:
On the basis of these discussions, collaboratively develop a plan [Note 15] that sets out the approach to monitoring, dosage adjustment, optimising nonpharmacological management (which is especially important if symptoms re-emerge) and indicators for restarting an antipsychotic. Involve relevant healthcare professionals in the plan’s development.
Despite limited evidence that it is safe to abruptly stop an antipsychotic used long term for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, it may be preferable to slowly reduce the dosage to reduce the risk of behavioural symptoms worsening and antipsychotic withdrawal symptoms. Reduce the dose by 25 to 50% every 1 to 2 weeks until the lowest practical dose is reached, then after 1 to 2 weeks, stop the antipsychotic. Consider a slower dosage reduction schedule for patients who were taking a high dose of an antipsychotic or who had severe symptoms initially.
During dose reduction, assess target symptoms and monitor for withdrawal symptoms every 1 to 2 weeks (ie every time a dose reduction is made) or more frequently if the patient was taking a high dose of an antipsychotic or had severe symptoms initially. If target symptoms become significant or severe withdrawal adverse effects occur, consider restarting the antipsychotic at the minimum effective dose and re-trial deprescribing after 3 months.

Depression in dementia
Comprehensively assess a patient with dementia who has a depressed mood to exclude differential diagnoses, determine factors contributing to symptoms and assess severity; see Assessing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and Assessing a person with depressive symptoms. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia is a useful tool to assess depression in patients with dementia.
Treat a patient with dementia who has major depression by optimising nonpharmacological interventions (see Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people and Nonpharmacological management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia) and offering psychological therapies (see Psychological therapies for major depression). There is a lack of evidence to support the use of antidepressants for major depression in dementia—a Cochrane review [Note 16] found they had limited or no efficacy. Antidepressants are associated with adverse effects (eg dry mouth, dizziness, hyponatraemia) and increase the risk of falls and fractures in older people—see Antidepressant adverse effects. Nevertheless, consider starting an antidepressant for major depression in dementia if the patient has:
If possible, use an antidepressant to which the patient has responded—see Antidepressant regimens. Avoid using an antidepressant with significant anticholinergic effects (eg tricyclic antidepressants), which can impair cognition and increase the risk of delirium.
If the patient has not previously taken an antidepressant, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline are commonly used. In choosing an antidepressant, consider the:
If an antidepressant is appropriate for depression in dementia, use:
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. If an unacceptable adverse effect is experienced, switch to an antidepressant less likely to cause the adverse effect and consider seeking specialist advice.

depressive-episodes-bipolar-disorder,"Principles of managing bipolar depression in adults and young people
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of depression, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.
In order to recognise a depressive episode as bipolar depression, a previous episode of mania or hypomania must have occurred (see Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in adults and young people). Refer patients with bipolar depression to a psychiatrist, a mental health service or an acute mental health facility but do not delay treatment if prompt review is not available.
A safety assessment determines the most appropriate treatment setting. It is crucial to assess the risk of suicide in patients with bipolar depression because most suicide attempts occur during a depressive episode. Also assess the severity of depression, level of functional impairment, ability to adhere to treatments and availability of psychosocial supports. Bipolar depression is usually managed by a psychiatrist, with care delivered by a community mental health team, a shared-care program with the general practitioner, or an outpatient program. Patients with severe symptoms of bipolar depression who are a danger to themselves or others require urgent treatment in hospital [Note 1]. Patients with depressive stupor need urgent psychiatric referral.
The primary aim of treatment is to alleviate depressive symptoms and restore functional capacity. Pharmacotherapy is usually required for bipolar depression (unless the episode is very mild or self-limiting). Drug choice is influenced by current or previous pharmacotherapy and response, the safety and tolerability of the drug, and clinical features. See Pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression for more detail and drug regimens. Continue treatment for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.
While pharmacotherapy is usually required for bipolar depression, psychological interventions can be used adjunctively. Start psychological interventions during an acute bipolar depressive episode, if possible, or soon afterwards when the patient may be more able to engage with treatment. Effective interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy and family-focused therapy. These interventions can result in a more rapid recovery and improved functioning. Continue psychosocial interventions after the acute depressive episode has settled, as they can help to prevent relapse and restore quality of life—see Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder in adults and young people.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is reserved for acutely depressed patients or urgent situations (eg depressive stupor, psychotic symptoms, substantive suicidal thoughts).
Optimised multimodal therapy and an adequate duration of drug therapy can prevent recurrent episodes, which are associated with worse long-term outcomes. Poor treatment adherence can lead to relapse or recurrent episodes; check blood drug concentrations where relevant [Note 2][Note 3]. Other common causes of recurrence or relapse include substance abuse, stressful life events or sleep issues. If relapse occurs, treat according to the mood episode and consider the need for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, in consultation with the patient’s psychiatrist.

Overview of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people
See Principles of managing bipolar depression in adults and young people for advice on the setting in which initial treatment should be delivered, the requirement for psychiatrist oversight and an overview of management.
Consider whether this is the first presentation of bipolar depression or if the patient is currently receiving treatment for bipolar depression and is relapsing or not responding. For patients currently receiving treatment and not responding, see Nonresponse to treatment for bipolar depression.
Although bipolar depression can be more difficult to treat than unipolar depression, most patients eventually respond to treatment. Because there is a limited evidence base to inform treatment choices, there are divergent international views on the optimal treatment of bipolar depression, in particular the role of antidepressants. Subsequently, recommendations for bipolar depression in international guidelines vary considerably. In general, treatment options for the acute treatment of bipolar depression are either monotherapy or combination therapy. Often monotherapy alone is ineffective or only partially effective for bipolar depression, so many patients require combination therapy. There have been no controlled head-to-head studies comparing the efficacy or tolerability of monotherapy to combination therapy.
The drugs recommended for monotherapy for bipolar depression are lamotrigine, lithium, lurasidone, olanzapine and quetiapine—these drugs have been demonstrated in controlled trials to be effective for bipolar depression without leading to switches into mania or rapid cycling. Do not use antidepressant monotherapy for bipolar depression because this can induce mania or rapid cycling.
Often monotherapy alone is ineffective or only partially effective for bipolar depression, so many patients require combination therapy. Combination therapy for bipolar depression involves combining an antidepressant with one of the following drugs to prevent manic switch: lithium, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine or sodium valproate. If the patient has a history of rapid cycling, mixed features, antidepressant-induced mood elevation or ongoing active substance use, combination therapy with an antidepressant should be used cautiously and guided by a psychiatrist because of the risk of inducing manic episodes or rapid cycling.
The decision to use monotherapy or combination therapy, and the choice of regimen, is influenced by the patient’s current treatment and past response to and tolerance of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression. Consider the drug’s propensity to cause adverse effects, in particular the adverse effects of antipsychotics. Consult a drug information source for advice on contraindications, precautions, adverse effects, dosage adjustments, clinical monitoring requirements before and during therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring [Note 4] [Note 5]. Drug therapy is usually prolonged (up to 12 months for an acute episode or longer if the patient requires prophylaxis of bipolar disorder), so consider tolerability carefully. Monitor patients for adverse effects of drug treatment. If adverse effects are suspected, lower the dose or switch to another drug with a lower propensity for adverse effects.
For drug regimens, see here for monotherapy and here for combination therapy.
See also additional considerations:
When choosing an antipsychotic for bipolar depression, discuss the following with the patient and, if they consent, their family, carers or significant others:
Antipsychotic choice must balance efficacy and tolerability (consider both short- and long-term adverse effects). Choice should be guided by the adverse effect profile and whether these are acceptable to the patient. Young people in particular are at risk of antipsychotic adverse effects including extrapyramidal adverse effects, effects due to elevated blood prolactin concentration, and weight gain.
Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40. Dosage should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for adverse effects). Slower dose escalation may be required for people who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects.
If adverse effects are suspected, lower the dose or switch to another drug with a lower propensity for adverse effects—see Switching antipsychotics.
When choosing an antidepressant for combination therapy, consider patient factors and drug properties as outlined for their use in major depression (see here). Of the antidepressant classes, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the least likely to induce a manic episode or provoke a rapid cycling pattern, whereas serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are most likely to cause these effects. While SSRIs are therefore usually the preferred antidepressant class for combination therapy, not all patients respond to SSRIs so use of an SNRI, TCA or MAOI may be considered (see Nonresponse to treatment of bipolar depression).
Young people are more susceptible to developing agitation, activation and suicidal thoughts when starting treatment with an antidepressant; this effect has been most often observed with SSRIs. Paroxetine should be avoided in young people because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours and other serious adverse events. Antidepressants may induce switch to mania more frequently in young people than adults.
Young people are also at increased risk of antipsychotic adverse effects including extrapyramidal adverse effects, effects due to elevated blood prolactin concentration, and weight gain.

Monotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people
See Overview of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people for a discussion of the choice between monotherapy or combination therapy for bipolar depression, drug choice and use in specific populations (eg pregnant people, young people).
When using an antipsychotic, slower dose escalation may be required for people who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects.
For monotherapy treatment of bipolar depression, use:
Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 week (except for lamotrigine, which takes longer given the slower dose titration); full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks, or even longer. If there is no response to monotherapy within this timeframe, see Nonresponse to treatment for bipolar depression
If there is an acceptable response, continue treatment for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.

Combination therapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people
See Overview of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people for a discussion on the choice between monotherapy or combination therapy for bipolar depression, drug choice and use in specific populations (eg pregnant people, young people).
Combination therapy for bipolar depression involves short-term use of an antidepressant combined with one of the following drugs: lithium, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine or sodium valproate.
When using an antipsychotic, slower dose escalation may be required for people who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects.
For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)–based combination therapy for bipolar depression, as a two-drug regimen, use:
During treatment with an antidepressant, monitor patients closely for signs of emerging hypomania or mania—this occurs more commonly in young people.
Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 week; full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks, or even longer. If there is no response or an inadequate response to SSRI-based combination therapy within these timeframes, see Nonresponse to treatment for bipolar depression.
If there is an acceptable response, continue combination therapy for 1 to 2 months after recovery from the depressive episode, then gradually reduce the dose of and stop the antidepressant (see Stopping an antidepressant for more detail). Continue with the other drug as monotherapy for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.
If the patient relapses when the antidepressant is withdrawn, they may be more prone to recurrent depressive episodes. Discontinuing the antidepressant is therefore not always possible—see Nonresponse to treatment for bipolar depression.

Pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression during pregnancy
The management of bipolar disorder in pregnancy is complex—see Considerations in managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy for advice on determining treatment approach.
The recommendations in this section are intended for a first episode of bipolar depression during pregnancy but can be used to guide drug choice if drug therapy needs to be changed in a patient with existing bipolar disorder.
If an episode of bipolar depression occurs during pregnancy, urgently seek psychiatric advice. Monotherapy with lamotrigine, quetiapine or olanzapine (see regimens here) is preferred to avoid the potential harms to the fetus associated with polypharmacy. For advice on antipsychotic use during pregnancy, see here and lamotrigine use during pregnancy, see here.
Only start lithium in the first trimester if the patient does not respond to an antipsychotic or lamotrigine because of the increased (although low) risk of congenital malformations with its use. Lithium therapy can be started from the second trimester onwards but should not be used with concurrent breastfeeding. For advice on lithium use during pregnancy, see here and breastfeeding, see here.
If monotherapy is inadequate, combine quetiapine, olanzapine or, if appropriate, lithium with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) other than paroxetine (sertraline is most commonly used)—see Antidepressant use during pregnancy and Overview of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people. If the patient intends to breastfeed, avoid starting fluoxetine during pregnancy because it has the highest reported concentrations, of all SSRIs, in breastmilk.
Do not start sodium valproate during pregnancy—see here.
Drug choice is also influenced by the patient’s desire to breastfeed—see Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.

Nonresponse to treatment of bipolar depression in adults and young people
If the patient has an inadequate response to pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression within 4 to 6 weeks, address any factors in Box 8.18 that could account for the response.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression or has a relapse.
If alternative reasons for nonresponse have been discounted, seek psychiatrist advice. Options to modify treatment include:

Principles of managing bipolar depression in children
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of bipolar depression, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children.
Bipolar depression is extremely rare in children and treatment should always be provided by a service with practitioners experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children.
Principles of managing bipolar depression in children are similar to those for adults and young people but there is less evidence to support the efficacy of the interventions in children."
disruptive-behaviour-children,"Overview of disruptive behaviour disorders in children
Disruptive behaviour disorders are conditions involving problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviours, and includes:
Disruptive behaviour disorders are relatively common in the community, occurring in about 10% of children and are often comorbid with other conditions (eg major depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability). If a disruptive behaviour disorder is suspected, refer to a psychiatrist or age-appropriate mental health service for confirmation of the diagnosis. Disruptive behaviour disorders commonly have a chronic course and a significant adverse impact on children and their families.
For the management of disruptive behaviour disorders in people with an intellectual disability, see Challenging behaviour.
Psychosocial treatment is first line for managing disruptive behaviour disorders. Provide psychoeducation, and refer to a psychologist, psychiatrist or age-appropriate mental health facility to address issues in the parent-child relationship—behavioural management and parenting programs are used.
Pharmacological treatment has a limited role in managing disruptive behaviour disorders, but may be considered if psychosocial treatment is not effective or if the patient is extremely aggressive. If pharmacotherapy is considered necessary, refer the patient to a psychiatrist or an age-appropriate mental health service.
Assess and treat comorbid conditions with psychosocial interventions and, if required, pharmacotherapy."
electroconvulsive-therapy-therapy,"Overview of electroconvulsive therapy
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) delivers an electric current to the brain and induces a seizure, resulting in rapid relief of symptoms of severe psychiatric disorders. ECT is administered under general anaesthesia and patients are also given a short-acting muscle relaxant before the procedure.
ECT can be used for severe psychiatric disorders, including in patients who have:
Most Australian states and territories have ECT legislation that details:
The stigma and anxiety associated with ECT can be a barrier to both clinicians and patients choosing this therapy. However, advances in technique and administration provide an improved balance between the benefits and harms of ECT.
Treatment approach is individualised to the patient, their disorder and their response to ECT. Individualisation can be achieved through adjustment of ECT parameters, such as current delivered, electrode placement, frequency of treatment. A course of ECT typically consists of multiple sessions, usually administered 2 to 3 times a week. Relapse rates after ECT are high and recovery should be maintained with pharmacotherapy. Occasionally, maintenance ECT is used for patients who do not respond to maintenance pharmacotherapy.
For advice on ECT during pregnancy, see here.

Adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy
Common adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) include muscle pain (associated with the muscle relaxant used before the procedure), headaches and transient confusion (lasting for approximately one hour after treatment).
Many patients have difficulty forming new memories during a treatment course of ECT; they may also already have cognitive impairments due to their underlying disorder. After the course of ECT, memory impairment generally returns to normal; memory may be improved during remission compared to pretreatment functioning. A small proportion of patients experience prolonged confusion or impairment in recall of remote autobiographical memories after a course of ECT. In general, both intra- and post-treatment memory problems are less with unilateral than bilateral ECT, and particularly less with ultra–brief current ECT.

Electroconvulsive therapy and concurrent psychotropic use
A plan for managing psychotropics during and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) should be developed by the patient’s psychiatrist in collaboration with the psychiatrist administering ECT. Some psychotropics may need to be stopped before ECT. The following information is included for reference only, for nonspecialists.
Benzodiazepines raise the seizure threshold and may impair the efficacy of ECT, and should be stopped before ECT.
There are limited benefits to continuing the patient’s antidepressant during ECT; some studies suggest that concurrent antidepressant use may increase the risk of adverse effects. Generally, all antidepressants should be stopped before administering ECT.
Although lithium does not impair the effectiveness of ECT, it may result in severe postictal confusion even at a low blood concentration. The treating psychiatrists should decide on the best approach to managing lithium during ECT.
Continuing an antiepileptic is likely to reduce the efficacy of ECT, prolong the course of ECT and impair cognition. In patients with epilepsy, antiepileptics should not usually be stopped because this increases the risk of seizures. In patients taking antiepileptics for the management of bipolar disorder, antiepileptics are ideally stopped before or early in the course of ECT. If required, antiepileptics can be restarted at the end of the course of ECT.
For psychoses, an antipsychotic should be continued unless clearly ineffective or adversely interacting with ECT (eg seizures related to clozapine use during ECT). Limited evidence suggests that outcomes when combining antipsychotics with ECT are better than for either treatment alone.

Electroconvulsive therapy during pregnancy
The stigma and anxiety associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be amplified during pregnancy; this can be a barrier to ECT for clinicians and patients. However, ECT is an important component of therapy for several psychiatric disorders. Failing to use ECT when indicated can increase the risk of harm to the patient and fetus, due to suicidality, impulsivity and self-neglect.
Although inadequate treatment of psychiatric disorders is associated with adverse outcomes for the patient and fetus, ECT can also cause adverse effects. In addition to its usual adverse effects, ECT during pregnancy can cause mild vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, transient benign fetal arrhythmias, uterine contractions (mostly transient) and preterm delivery. Some case reports and series describe relatively high rates of fetal adverse events (up to 29%); however, safety data are limited and there are insufficient high-quality data to determine a causal link with ECT.
ECT is an option if a pregnant patient usually takes a teratogenic psychotropic (eg sodium valproate) and alternative treatments cannot be used.
To prepare a pregnant patient for ECT, follow the same process as for nonpregnant patients, but also consult with the patient’s obstetrician—ECT should be used with caution if the patient has a condition that could lead to placental compromise (eg hypertension, diabetes). The anaesthetic care for pregnant patients undergoing ECT should be undertaken by an anaesthetist with expertise in ECT in pregnancy. Fetal cardiotocographic monitoring is required before, during and after ECT."
first-episode-psychosis,"Assessing a first episode of psychosis in adults and young people
When assessing an adult or young person with psychotic symptoms for the first time, consider:
Before comprehensively assessing a person with psychotic symptoms, determine if they pose a threat to themselves or others. If there is a risk of harm, see Approach to managing acute behavioural disturbance.
Positive signs and symptoms
hallucinations (eg hearing voices)
delusions (eg persecutory, bizarre, grandiose)
impaired insight
disorganised thinking and speech
Negative signs and symptoms
lack of motivation
poor self-care
blunted affect
reduced speech
social withdrawal
Cognitive signs and symptoms
impaired planning
reduced mental flexibility
impaired memory and concentration
impaired social cognition [NB2]
Excitement
disorganised behaviour
aggression

Positive psychotic signs and symptoms are a feature of many conditions that should be considered as possible diagnoses:
If it is safe to do so, observe patients with psychotic signs or symptoms for 24 to 48 hours before starting antipsychotic therapy. During this time:
When acute signs and symptoms have settled, undertake neurocognitive testing, if available, to identify cognitive deficits, because cognitive symptoms require targeted treatment.
Assessments to help identify cause(s) of psychotic signs and symptoms include:
Additional assessments for people at risk of conditions associated with psychotic signs and symptoms, include:

Principles of treating a first episode of psychosis in adults and young people
The principles in this topic apply to the acute treatment of a first psychotic episode. For principles of ongoing care, see here.
Ideally, a first episode of psychosis should be managed by a specialist—urgently refer patients to a psychiatrist or mental health service because early treatment reduces the period of untreated psychosis and improves outcomes. Young people should be referred to a youth mental health service such as Headspace, if available.
Evaluate whether admission to hospital is needed [Note 1]. Considerations include:
Treatment of a first episode of psychosis must be multifaceted and individualised (see Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia). Antipsychotic therapy is a key component of treatment and is continued after the acute episode to facilitate recovery, and prevent relapse (which is common after a first episode of psychosis) and suicide.
If possible, delay starting antipsychotic therapy for 24 to 48 hours to facilitate assessment and diagnosis. If interim treatment is required for acute agitation, see below. If the patient has trouble sleeping, see Insomnia for advice on whether short-term pharmacotherapy is indicated.

Treating agitation in adults and young people with psychosis
Agitation is common in acute psychosis but usually settles within days. If a patient with psychosis is acutely agitated, only provide treatment if it is safe and appropriate to do so. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm.
If a patient with psychosis remains agitated but is willing to accept an oral sedative, use:
When selecting a suitable benzodiazepine and determining its dose, consider patient factors, such as level of agitation, body size, age, sex, comorbidities, treatment setting, drug history, previous response to sedatives, current treatment response, and whether the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Modest benzodiazepine doses should be used initially in patients treated in the community, particularly in those who are benzodiazepine naïve.
If diazepam or lorazepam cannot be used, use a suitable dose of the patient’s antipsychotic [Note 4] as required, but do not exceed the maximum daily dose of the antipsychotic (including regular doses—see maximum oral doses in Table 8.19 and, if a long-acting injectable is used, approximate equivalent oral dosages in Table 8.22). However, there are few data to support ‘as needed’ (prn) administration of antipsychotics, and it can worsen agitation and increases the risk of adverse effects (eg akathisia). After the agitation has resolved, do not continue the antipsychotic at the increased dose to manage the disorder.
If the patient remains acutely agitated and at risk of harming themselves or others 30 to 60 minutes after the administration of the benzodiazepine or antipsychotic, or if the patient will not accept an oral sedative, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for further advice.
Consult a psychiatrist to consider zuclopenthixol acetate if the patient has any of the following features:
If recurrent agitation and aggression is likely to continue for the next 2 to 3 days, if appropriate, a psychiatrist may use:
Zuclopenthixol acetate has an onset of action within 2 hours and the peak effect is achieved approximately 24 hours after administration. Patients should be monitored after receiving zuclopenthixol acetate.

Antipsychotic choice for a first episode of psychosis in adults and young people
If antipsychotic therapy for a first episode of psychosis is considered necessary after observing the patient for 24 to 48 hours, if possible, discuss the following with the patient and, if the patient consents, their family, carers or significant others:
Antipsychotic choice must balance efficacy, and short- and long-term tolerability. For drugs with similar efficacy, choice should be guided by the adverse effect profile and patient factors, including their physical health (see Baseline parameters potentially affected by antipsychotic therapy) and which adverse effects are acceptable to the patient. Also consider the availability of a long-acting injectable formulation. Use an antipsychotic for its antipsychotic properties, not sedation. If short-term management of agitation is required, it is preferable to add a benzodiazepine; see here.
Amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone have been shown in randomised controlled trials to have efficacy in treating a first episode of psychosis—there is minimal difference in efficacy between these antipsychotics. However, for people younger than 18 years, data suggest ziprasidone is not effective for schizophrenia. Do not use olanzapine as first-line therapy, despite evidence of efficacy, because it has severe metabolic adverse effects. For this reason, olanzapine is a third-line treatment option in these guidelines.
Although asenapine, brexpiprazole, lurasidone and paliperidone are effective antipsychotics, these drugs are ranked second line in these guidelines because, at the time of writing, randomised controlled trial data for a first episode of psychosis are lacking.
Sequential trials of monotherapy may be required until the best balance of effectiveness and adverse effects is achieved. For antipsychotic regimens, see here.
Occasionally, because of cost or availability, the older antipsychotics chlorpromazine, haloperidol, periciazine or zuclopenthixol are used to treat psychosis. These drugs are effective but more likely to cause extrapyramidal adverse effects and lead to treatment discontinuation, and have been associated with lower quality of life.
For additional considerations in antipsychotic choice, see:

Monitoring and titrating antipsychotic therapy for a first episode of psychosis
Monitoring antipsychotic therapy involves assessment of treatment response and monitoring for adverse effects. If daytime sedation is an issue with daily doses, give the dose at night. See Antipsychotic adverse effects for advice on monitoring for, preventing and addressing adverse effects.
Positive symptoms should start to improve within 1 week of starting an antipsychotic; it may take several weeks and achievement of target dose before symptoms adequately respond. Negative symptoms, however, may not respond to antipsychotic therapy—see Managing negative symptoms in psychoses including schizophrenia for targeted treatment.
The frequency of dose increases depends on the patient’s severity of symptoms and degree of distress, the setting in which treatment is delivered, and the pharmacokinetics of the drug. A slower dose increase may be required for some people (eg younger people, older adults), particularly those who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects.
If there is an inadequate response at the target dose, address any factors in Box 8.41 that could account for the response—if poor adherence is likely, consider starting a long-acting injectable formulation. If the inadequate response is not explained by these factors, increase to the maximum antipsychotic dose. If there is still minimal response after 4 weeks of treatment at the maximum dose, or no response after 2 weeks, and alternative reasons for treatment failure have been excluded, switch to an oral antipsychotic with a different dopaminergic receptor occupancy profile (for which adverse effect profile is a surrogate).
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antipsychotic or has a relapse.
Sequential trials of monotherapy may be required until the best balance of effectiveness and adverse effects is achieved. If symptoms of psychosis do not substantially settle after monotherapy with 2 different antipsychotics, see Treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Duration of antipsychotic therapy for a first episode of psychosis
After a first episode of psychosis, continue antipsychotic therapy to facilitate recovery, and prevent relapse and suicide—see Principles of recovery and relapse prevention for advice on long-term treatment.
The minimum duration of antipsychotic therapy for a first episode of psychosis depends on the duration of symptoms and how quickly the patient responds to treatment.
For principles of stopping antipsychotic therapy, see here.

Assessing and treating a first episode of psychosis in children
Psychosis rarely occurs before puberty and is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Urgently refer children who display signs or symptoms of psychosis, accompanied by their family, carers, or significant others to a specialist centre (eg Headspace for children 12 years or older) or, if a specialist centre is not available, a child psychiatrist or age-appropriate mental health team. Early treatment improves outcomes. For principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia in children, see here."
generalised-anxiety-disorder,"Diagnosing generalised anxiety disorder
Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by unrelenting excessive worry or anxiety over everyday matters. The person’s worry can be over things in or out of their control and is relentless, resulting in the person being constantly ‘on edge’. Generalised anxiety disorder has a fluctuating course but tends to be a long-term disorder and affects up to 6% of the Australian population. Females are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop generalised anxiety disorder.
The diagnostic criteria for generalised anxiety disorder described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are:
Anxiety in children can manifest as tantrums, crying, clinging or freezing.
Patients with generalised anxiety disorder may present during an acute crisis when anxiety is severe and disabling, or causing the patient unacceptable distress.
There is significant overlap between generalised anxiety disorder and other anxiety disorders—see Overview of anxiety and associated disorders for information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders. Generalised anxiety disorder is often comorbid with and may mask:

Approach to managing generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Psychosocial interventions, including psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy), are first-line treatments for generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people. Ongoing supportive psychosocial treatment is required in all patients.
Pharmacotherapy may be used when psychotherapy is not available, not effective or not preferred, or if symptoms are severe. If pharmacotherapy is appropriate, start an antidepressant for maintenance therapy. Short-term treatment with a benzodiazepine may also be needed initially because it can take several weeks before an effect is seen with an antidepressant.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as generalised anxiety disorder in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.
For patients presenting during an acute crisis, if possible use nonpharmacological measures to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated and is at risk of harming themselves or others, see the advice on drug therapy for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or older people. If the patient is agitated but not at risk of harming themselves or others, consider using a short-term benzodiazepine.

Approach to managing generalised anxiety disorder in children
Psychosocial interventions, including psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy), are first-line treatment for generalised anxiety disorder in children. Children with generalised anxiety disorder rarely require pharmacotherapy but it may be used if psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, or if symptoms are severe. Pharmacotherapy is also recommended for children with comorbid depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use it concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.

Psychosocial interventions for generalised anxiety disorder
Initial treatment for generalised anxiety disorder includes psychoeducation, and advice on coping skills and relaxation techniques. Implement stress management approaches such as:
Use psychological therapies, if available; these should be provided by an experienced and trained clinician. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has the best evidence for generalised anxiety disorder; it involves challenging worrying thoughts about feared events and specifically addressing the process of worrying. There is also limited evidence for psychoeducation, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction and psychodynamic psychotherapy.
Psychosocial interventions in children should be tailored to the child’s age and family situation. Always involve the child’s family or carers in management. Consider if there is a history of past or current trauma that may be contributing to the anxiety.
Ongoing supportive psychosocial treatment (eg stress management approaches) is required in all patients.

Short-term pharmacotherapy for generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Follow the approach to managing generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people.
A short-term benzodiazepine may be needed adjunctively with an antidepressant for maintenance therapy because it can take several weeks before an effect is seen with an antidepressant. Short-term adjunctive benzodiazepine use can be considered for anxiety that is severe and disabling, or causing the patient unacceptable distress. However, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence. These risks are of particular concern in older people, in whom harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits (see Principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders).
If a short-term benzodiazepine is considered appropriate to treat generalised anxiety disorder in an adult or young person, use:

Maintenance pharmacotherapy for generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Follow the approach to managing generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people.
If an antidepressant is indicated for generalised anxiety disorder in an adult or young person (if psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, or if symptoms are severe), initial choice should be informed by:
SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) are first-line drugs for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Of the SSRIs, escitalopram has the largest evidence base in generalised anxiety disorder but there are no head-to-head comparisons to show it is more effective than other SSRIs.
Serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine) have high-quality evidence of effect in generalised anxiety disorder and relatively good patient acceptability. Duloxetine may particularly improve anxious thoughts.
If particularly concerned about sensitivity to early adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation) of an SSRI or SNRI, consider using a lower starting dose. However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information.
If an SSRI or SNRI is considered appropriate to treat generalised anxiety disorder, individualise the choice of drug (see above). Use:

Initial pharmacotherapy for generalised anxiety disorder in children
Follow the approach to managing generalised anxiety disorder in children.
Psychosocial interventions are first-line treatment for generalised anxiety disorder in children. When psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, or if symptoms are severe, pharmacotherapy may be used. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use this concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline) are first-line drugs for generalised anxiety disorder. Paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events. Although there are more data for older SSRIs, all SSRIs are likely to have similar effectiveness.
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for generalised anxiety disorder, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children, whereas the maximum doses approximate those used in adults and young people. In children 12 years and older, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for generalised anxiety disorder, use:

Follow-up and duration of pharmacotherapy for generalised anxiety disorder
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.3). Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 to 2 weeks; full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for generalised anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Consider modifying treatment for generalised anxiety disorder in an adult or young person if symptoms persist despite:
Options for treatment modification include:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as generalised anxiety disorder in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.
Pregabalin is a rapidly effective drug for generalised anxiety disorder—effects are usually seen within a week. Early response (a 20 to 30% improvement within 2 weeks) is predictive of a more substantial long-term response. Before prescribing, consider the potential for harm with pregabalin use, including severe adverse effects, potential for dependence, abuse and toxicity in overdose. Pregabalin has been associated with altered or worsening mood, and emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviours; the risk may be particularly high in young people. See also Principles of using drugs associated with emergent suicidality.
A suitable regimen of pregabalin for generalised anxiety disorder is:
Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information.
When stopping pregabalin, gradually decrease the dose to avoid precipitating a seizure. There is limited evidence regarding an appropriate deprescribing regimen, but a reasonable approach is to reduce the dose by approximately 25 to 30% every 2 weeks. Regularly assess for re-emergence of anxiety symptoms.
Quetiapine reduces generalised anxiety symptoms. Quetiapine has antihistaminergic effects at low doses. However, use of quetiapine is limited by the risk of cardiometabolic adverse effects, problem use and overdose, and is subject to monitoring by drug diversion monitoring systems in some Australian states. Discuss with the patient potential adverse effects associated with antipsychotic use and how these effects are monitored, and potentially prevented or addressed. Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40. Dosage should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for adverse effects). Slower dose escalation may be required for people who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects. Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. A suitable regimen of quetiapine for generalised anxiety disorder is:
There is limited evidence regarding an appropriate deprescribing regimen for quetiapine when used for generalised anxiety disorder. Ideally, reduce the dose by approximately 25% every 1 to 2 weeks. Regularly assess for re-emergence of anxiety symptoms.
Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder. However, they should not be used as first-line pharmacotherapy because of potential harms (including increased risk of falls, memory problems, accidents, daytime sedation and dependence). Caution is needed in older people and patients who have a history of problem substance use (particularly problem alcohol use). If a benzodiazepine is used for an older person, lower doses may be needed; consult a source of drug information.
Benzodiazepine use is usually restricted to acute crises and short-term initial therapy. In treatment resistance, they may be considered for maintenance therapy, ideally in consultation with a psychiatrist. Follow the principles for the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders.
If a benzodiazepine is considered appropriate for generalised anxiety disorder, a suitable regimen is:
Other drugs that may be considered for generalised anxiety disorder include agomelatine and mirtazapine; however, their efficacy and tolerability are only supported by studies with small sample sizes. If agomelatine or mirtazapine is considered appropriate for generalised anxiety disorder, a suitable regimen is:
Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information.

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for generalised anxiety disorder in children
Refer children with generalised anxiety disorder to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input, if their symptoms persist despite:
While quetiapine or a benzodiazepine may be considered for adults or young people who have failed to respond to initial treatment, they should be avoided in children. Quetiapine is associated with metabolic adverse effects and there is insufficient evidence to support benzodiazepine use."
grief,"Grief
For information about grief in the palliative care setting, see Loss, grief and bereavement.
Grief is a normal response after a significant loss (eg death of a spouse, loss of employment, loss of independence), severe illness or personal injury. It presents with thoughts and feelings of emptiness and loss, and may be accompanied by a wide variety of symptoms, including insomnia and sadness. Acute grief can be debilitating in the short term but is usually integrated over time, and the person is able to resume their day-to-day functioning. However, the loss of a spouse or loved one can be a trigger for a depressive episode; some of the symptoms may mimic major depression or another psychiatric disorder. Uncomplicated acute grief is not accompanied by feelings of worthlessness or strong suicidal thoughts, and improves with time. If the person has feelings of worthlessness or strong suicidal thoughts, assess for major depression or another depressive disorder (see Assessing a person with depressive symptoms and Assessing suicide risk).
Conventional supports (eg family, social, religious) are usually sufficient to help someone who is acutely grieving. Support from a clinician can also be helpful. There is a limited role for pharmacotherapy in acute grief. Anxiolytics or hypnotics may be trialled to alleviate excessive anxiety or insomnia for a brief period (fewer than 7 days)."
hoarding-disorder,"Hoarding disorder
Hoarding disorder is an obsessive compulsive–related disorder characterised by anxiety about discarding possessions, irrespective of their monetary value. This results in substantial accumulation of possessions and extreme clutter in the living environment. Patients’ insight varies, with some patients lacking insight or having delusional beliefs, which makes treatment challenging.
Hoarding disorder has poor prognosis and is poorly responsive to therapy. Psychosocial interventions are first line and should be administered by clinicians with expertise in treating hoarding disorder. Initial treatment includes psychoeducation. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with an exposure and response prevention (ExRP) component is the treatment of choice.
Small trials in adults have shown a benefit with venlafaxine, atomoxetine and modified-release methylphenidate but, at the time of writing, these treatments are not used in practice.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as hoarding disorder during the perinatal period, see here, or for considerations in partners, see here."
hypomanic-epidoses-bipolar-disorder,"Principles of managing hypomania in adults and young people
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of hypomania, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.
A hypomanic episode is characterised by symptoms similar to those of a manic episode, but is differentiated from a manic episode by less severe symptoms that do not impair functioning (see Features of bipolar disorder). The symptoms, last at least 4 consecutive days and are present for most of the day. It may be difficult to distinguish symptoms of hypomania from substance intoxication (eg stimulants) or early symptoms of a manic episode. If hypomania is suspected in a patient without a known history of bipolar disorder, refer to a psychiatrist or mental health team for assessment and confirmation of the diagnosis. In a patient with a known history of bipolar disorder, review the patient regularly to determine if their symptoms develop into acute mania.
Patients with bipolar disorder rarely seek treatment during a hypomanic episode because they usually do not recognise their thoughts, feelings or behaviours as unusual, and instead, may see the experience as positive and not indicative of illness. Symptoms of hypomania might be identified by significant others, family or carers.
Unlike acute mania, hypomania is self-limiting and not an emergency. In general, hypomania does not require acute treatment but may require adjustments to the patient’s treatment and use of psychosocial interventions; however, there is little evidence to guide treatment. If the patient is concerned by their symptoms, consider treating specific symptoms, such as:
Consider referral to a psychiatrist or community mental health team.
See also the additional considerations:

Principles of managing hypomania in children
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of hypomania, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children.
The principles of treating hypomania in children are similar to those in adults and young people; however, treatment should always be provided by a service with practitioners experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children."
informed-consent-shared-decision-making,"Informed consent for a person with a psychiatric disorder
Seek consent from the person before starting treatment for a psychiatric disorder. Issues for clinicians to consider when assessing consent to treatment in a person with a psychiatric disorder are outlined in Box 8.1.
For a person’s consent to be valid, it must be given without coercion and in accordance with the relevant local policies and legislation. The person must have adequate decision-making capacity to provide consent (ie ability to give informed consent to a particular decision at a particular time) and have been provided with adequate information to enable them to reach and communicate an informed decision about their treatment (see Shared decision making for a person with a psychiatric disorder). Even if the person lacks the capacity to provide informed consent, they should be involved in the process of consent. Equally, it is important to engage the person in treatment decisions, even if they are receiving involuntary treatment in accordance with relevant mental health legislation. When safe and feasible, a person’s treatment decisions should be supported even if they do not align with what is considered optimal care.
When people with psychiatric disorders have capacity to consent, they should be able to provide or withdraw consent to treatment freely and without coercion. If the person lacks the capacity to consent to certain treatments, they may still be able to provide consent on other matters.
If there are concerns about the person’s capacity to provide consent and a particular treatment is considered necessary, refer to the relevant State or Territory legislation for information on who can provide consent (see also Box 8.2). If urgent intervention is required and it is not possible to obtain consent, the principle of ‘duty of care’ may be used as a rationale for medical intervention without obtaining consent. If in doubt, consider the likely consequences of not intervening—consult a senior colleague whenever possible.
A person’s capacity to provide informed consent may fluctuate over time. Capacity to provide informed consent should be reviewed periodically and appropriate action taken to ensure that consent continues to be valid.

Shared decision making for a person with a psychiatric disorder
Shared decision making enables doctors and patients to make health decisions in partnership, informed by the best available evidence and the patient’s values and preferences.
Patients who take part in shared decision making have a more accurate understanding of the benefits and harms of the available treatment options.
A shared decision-making approach should be used when discussing treatment options for the patient’s psychiatric disorder. Shared decision making promotes engagement in the therapeutic process, empowerment and increased adherence to treatment decisions. The clinician’s role in the shared decision-making process is outlined in Box 8.3.
If a consumer wellness plan or similar advance care directive is available, this may also be used to assist in shared decision making. A consumer wellness plan (also referred to as a Wellness Recovery Action Plan) contains information about a patient’s choices and preferences for the ongoing care of their mental health, particularly in terms of symptom management, relapse prevention and crisis planning.
Treatment decision aids are used widely in other areas of medicine to facilitate shared decision making, but are not yet standard practice for psychiatric disorders [Note 1]."
insomnia-adults,"What is insomnia?
Insomnia is difficulty falling or staying asleep, which results in significant daytime sequelae (eg fatigue, irritability, impaired concentration and memory) and distress.
People with insomnia are more likely to be involved in accidents. People with chronic insomnia (ie those with established sleep problems) take more sick leave and are at higher risk of medical conditions (eg cardiovascular disease, diabetes), psychiatric disorders (eg depression, anxiety) and premature death.

Assessing an adult with insomnia
Assessing an adult with suspected insomnia helps to:
Assessment involves:
A sleep diary and various sleep questionnaires can aide assessment. Consumer sleep technologies have a limited role in the assessment of sleep disorders.
For additional considerations in assessing insomnia in:

In the sleep diary, the patient documents the time they went to bed and got to sleep; number of hours slept; number, duration and reasons for night-time awakenings; when they woke and arose and whether they felt refreshed. In addition, they record lifestyle, environmental or medical factors that may impact sleep (eg drugs, caffeine and alcohol intake, exercise, meals). An initial observation period of 1 to 2 weeks may be prolonged to monitor change in sleep behaviour.
Organisations with sleep diaries, include:
Consider using the following self-reported sleep questionnaires as part of assessing an adult with suspected insomnia:
Various devices (eg watches, phone applications) claim to monitor and analyse sleep. Although these technologies may increase sleep awareness, thereby encouraging engagement in sleep disorder assessment and treatment, consumer sleep technologies are not considered to be sufficiently reliable to diagnose sleep disorders. There is a lack of evidence to justify the use of these technologies in place of gold-standard sleep assessments (eg polysomnography). For some people, using smart sleep technology may increase sleep-related anxiety.

Principles of treating insomnia in adults
The goals of treating insomnia are to reduce nocturnal hyperarousal, improve sleep quality and quantity, and relieve distress and daytime impairment. Use the following multimodal approach to achieve these goals:
Ask the patient to keep a sleep diary to monitor their sleep and treatment progress.
Review a patient with insomnia regularly. Chronic insomnia can be a primary disorder and should be treated independently of related conditions. Consider referral to a sleep expert if the patient does not respond to therapy.
Although widely used, pharmacological therapy has a limited role in the treatment of insomnia—see here for advice.
Patients are often interested in taking complementary medicines to treat insomnia. Limited evidence suggests that complementary medicines (eg valerian, chamomile, hops, wuling, passionflower, kava) are no more effective than placebo for treating insomnia. Although these herbs appear to be generally well tolerated and are only associated with mild adverse effects, kava and valerian have very rarely caused liver damage. Advise patients interested in taking complementary medicines to visit the Sleep Health Foundation website for further information.

For considerations in treating psychiatric disorders in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Psychological and behavioural interventions for insomnia in adults
Psychological and behavioural interventions effectively treat insomnia and are first-line therapy, in combination with addressing factors that affect sleep and optimising sleep practices.
Educate and encourage all patients with insomnia to implement good sleep practices.
Choice of intervention depends on the nature of insomnia (ie acute versus chronic and the portion of the sleep cycle affected) and resources available.
For patients with acute insomnia, as relevant, recommend:
For patients with chronic insomnia, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first-line therapy. If cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia cannot be undertaken, as relevant, use the interventions listed for acute insomnia above.
Patients with chronic insomnia are often anxious about not sleeping as much as they perceive to be necessary (see Table 8.13 for recommended sleep durations). This can lead to distorted beliefs about adverse consequences of sleep deprivation and sleep anxiety (a cycle in which worrying about not sleeping increases arousal at bedtime and contributes further to insomnia). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) aims to address unhelpful beliefs and worries about sleep, reduce nocturnal hyperarousal and change behaviours that impair sleep. It is a multicomponent treatment involving cognitive behavioural therapy, education about good sleep practices and, as relevant:
Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia can be delivered face-to-face (individually or in a group setting) by an experienced and trained clinician, or self-administered (eg using an online format). Ideally, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is delivered face-to-face over 4 to 6 sessions. If a digital format is preferred, products available include:
The use of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia has been limited because of cost, number of trained practitioners, lack of patient willingness to commit time to the program, and lack of awareness and acceptance of the potential benefits by patients and health practitioners.
Educate patients with insomnia about normal sleep (see Table 8.13 for recommended sleep durations) and encourage them to implement good sleep practices. Although the evidence for these practices is limited, they are recommended because they may be effective and are unlikely to cause harm.

Relaxation techniques are most effective if practised during the day, before going to bed and in the middle of the night, if the patient is unable to go back to sleep. To achieve maximal benefit, daily practice over several weeks may be required.
Stimulus control limits the amount of time spent awake in bed, conditioning the patient to associate their bed and bedroom with sleep and intimacy only. Stimulus control is useful for patients who associate their bed or bedroom with frustration, worry and poor sleep. These patients are often ‘wired and tired’ rather than sleepy.
Stimulus control involves:
Sleep restriction programs aim to reduce time spent awake in bed by building natural sleep drive. The patient estimates their sleep in a sleep diary. Time spent in bed is then restricted to this estimation. Initially this results in sleep deprivation, but after a few nights, this sleep deprivation helps to consolidate sleep and improve sleep efficiency (ie time in bed approximates time asleep). As sleep efficiency improves, time spent in bed increases. An example of a sleep restriction program is shown in Box 8.34.
A patient reports they sleep 4 to 5 hours a night, despite being in bed from 10.00 pm to 8.00 am. Their sleep diary estimates that they usually sleep between 1 and 6 am.
Time in bed is restricted to 5 hours a night (ie bedtime is 1.00 am and arising time is 6.00 am). This sleep schedule is maintained until the patient regularly sleeps well (ie time in bed approximates time asleep) and craves sleep earlier.
At this point, time in bed is increased by 30 minutes until the patient sleeps well and craves sleep earlier. Incrementally, 30 minutes of extra sleep time is added to the total sleep time until the patient sleeps well for an adequate duration.
Several other interventions have been proposed as treatments for insomnia including diet, acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, biofeedback, music, aromatherapy and massage. Although high-quality evidence to support these interventions is lacking, they may be helpful treatment adjuncts.

Psychological and behavioural interventions effectively treat insomnia and are first-line therapy, in combination with addressing factors that affect sleep and optimising sleep practices.
Educate and encourage all patients with insomnia to implement good sleep practices.
Choice of intervention depends on the nature of insomnia (ie acute versus chronic and the portion of the sleep cycle affected) and resources available.
For patients with acute insomnia, as relevant, recommend:
For patients with chronic insomnia, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first-line therapy. If cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia cannot be undertaken, as relevant, use the interventions listed for acute insomnia above.

Patients with chronic insomnia are often anxious about not sleeping as much as they perceive to be necessary (see Table 8.13 for recommended sleep durations). This can lead to distorted beliefs about adverse consequences of sleep deprivation and sleep anxiety (a cycle in which worrying about not sleeping increases arousal at bedtime and contributes further to insomnia). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) aims to address unhelpful beliefs and worries about sleep, reduce nocturnal hyperarousal and change behaviours that impair sleep. It is a multicomponent treatment involving cognitive behavioural therapy, education about good sleep practices and, as relevant:
Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia can be delivered face-to-face (individually or in a group setting) by an experienced and trained clinician, or self-administered (eg using an online format). Ideally, cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is delivered face-to-face over 4 to 6 sessions. If a digital format is preferred, products available include:
The use of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia has been limited because of cost, number of trained practitioners, lack of patient willingness to commit time to the program, and lack of awareness and acceptance of the potential benefits by patients and health practitioners.

Educate patients with insomnia about normal sleep (see Table 8.13 for recommended sleep durations) and encourage them to implement good sleep practices. Although the evidence for these practices is limited, they are recommended because they may be effective and are unlikely to cause harm.

Pharmacological treatment for insomnia in adults
Before considering a drug for insomnia, comprehensively assess the patient to determine the type and impact of insomnia and identify contributing or causative factors. Often, a drug will not be required if:
Only consider using a drug to treat acute insomnia if the following criteria are met:
For chronic insomnia, in addition to meeting the above criteria for drug use for acute insomnia, only consider using a drug if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is ineffective or not preferred by the patient.
Avoid using a drug as sole treatment for insomnia—see Principles of treating insomnia in adults.
If a drug is considered necessary for insomnia, consider the factors in Table 8.15 to guide choice.

for sleep-onset (initial) insomnia (ie trouble falling asleep), a drug with a short half-life (eg zolpidem or immediate-release melatonin) may be preferable (and in the case of a hypnotic, less likely to cause hangover symptoms the following day)
for sleep-maintenance (middle) insomnia (ie waking often or for prolonged periods throughout the night), late insomnia (ie waking more than 30 minutes before desired wake-up time and not returning to sleep), or a combination of initial and middle or late insomnia, a longer-acting drug (eg zopiclone, temazepam, modified-release melatonin, suvorexant) may be preferable
drug harm–benefit profile
see advice on hypnotics, melatonin and suvorexant—do not use sedating antidepressants (in the absence of comorbid depression), sedating antihistamines, antipsychotics, gabapentin or pregabalin to treat insomnia (see Other drugs commonly used for insomnia)
Before starting a hypnotic (eg temazepam, zopiclone, zolpidem), discuss the potential benefits, limitations and harms with the patient so they can make an informed decision about using one.
Hypnotics are effective in inducing and maintaining sleep and increase total sleep time.
Despite these benefits, many patients find their sleep is not refreshing when aided by a hypnotic and can suffer daytime hangover effects (eg sedation, cognitive impairment, impaired driving). Hypnotics with longer half-lives are more likely to cause daytime impairment. Temazepam, with a half-life of approximately 10 hours, is the only benzodiazepine recommended for insomnia in these guidelines—diazepam and nitrazepam, for example, have much longer half-lives (more than 24 hours).
In addition to the risk of daytime sedation, zolpidem, and potentially all hypnotics, can induce dangerous complex sleep-related behaviours (see Parasomnias), and paradoxical reactions (eg hallucinations, acute rage, agitation)—advise the patient to stop the hypnotic if these effects occur.
Explain to the patient that broken sleep with vivid dreams may occur when the hypnotic is stopped and that it takes several days or weeks for a normal sleep rhythm to re-establish. This rebound insomnia does not indicate that further hypnotic use is needed.
For considerations in using:
If the potential benefits associated with short-term hypnotic use exceed the potential harms, assess for risk of misuse—see Box 8.35. If the risk is low, use the lowest possible dose intermittently for the shortest possible time—see regimens here. Agree upon a duration of use with the patient before starting the hypnotic, and limit the quantity supplied. Explain the reason for this approach to the patient; the risk of hypnotic tolerance and dependence increases as duration of therapy increases—see also Insomnia in an adult who has taken a hypnotic long term. Zopiclone and zolpidem may have less potential for dependence than benzodiazepines.
Advise the patient to avoid taking a hypnotic concurrently with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants; concurrent use increases the risk of potentially serious adverse effects.
Melatonin is a hormone that regulates circadian rhythm and sleep. Clinical trial data show that melatonin may reduce sleep-onset time and improve sleep quality in adults with insomnia, but data are conflicting and the clinical significance of improvements is small. Melatonin is well tolerated; it does not appear to have abuse potential and reduces hypnotic use. Melatonin does not appear to cause daytime sedation, although high doses (eg 5 mg) may have hypnotic properties.
For melatonin regimens for insomnia in adults, see here.
For considerations in using melatonin in pregnancy, see here and breastfeeding, see here.
Suvorexant is an orexin A and B receptor antagonist. Although clinical trial data indicate that suvorexant modestly improves sleep-onset time, reduces wakening after sleep onset, improves sleep efficiency and total sleep time in adults with chronic insomnia, there is limited clinical experience with its use in Australia. Suvorexant should not be combined with other sedatives or alcohol—this increases the risk of adverse effects (eg abnormal dreams).

If a drug is considered necessary to treat insomnia in an adult, consider factors influencing drug choice and use:

Insomnia in older people
Sleep problems become more common with age. Sleep time, depth and efficiency decrease and older people can experience a shift in their sleep–wake cycle resulting in earlier sleep onset and morning waking—see Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder. These normal changes can be misconstrued as pathological—see Table 8.13 for recommended sleep times throughout life.
As people age, they may become less active and mobile and have less exposure to natural light, all of which decrease sleep drive. Reduced social contact and lack of routine can also contribute to sleep problems. Older people are more likely to have comorbidities or take prescribed drugs that affect sleep—see Contributing or causative factors for insomnia. Insomnia can contribute to depression, poor quality of life, cognitive impairment and increase risk of falls.
Apply the principles of treating insomnia to treat insomnia in older people. Good sleep practices are applicable to older people including those in aged-care facilities—provide stimulating activities during the day to reduce napping, encourage a daytime routine and maximise daytime (particularly morning) exposure to light. Avoid forcing older people to go to bed early; going to bed later can increase sleep efficiency. Avoid using hypnotics in older people—see below.
Avoid using hypnotics in older people. Harms associated with hypnotic use (eg falls, fractures, impaired cognition) generally outweigh the benefits. In fact, a meta-analysis [Note 9] found that 13 older people would need to be treated with a hypnotic for one person to have improved sleep; however, only 6 older people would need to be treated for one person to experience an adverse event. If a hypnotic is used to treat insomnia in an older adult:

Insomnia in dementia
People with dementia often have marked sleep fragmentation—they may doze during the day and experience sundowning (agitation and wandering) in the early evening or at night. Sleep problems can be behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia—see here for assessment advice. Avoid using drugs to treat insomnia in people with dementia—there is insufficient evidence to support their use. See also Insomnia in older people.

Insomnia in the perinatal period
Sleep is frequently impaired in the perinatal period.
The approach to assessing sleep problems in the perinatal period is the same as for the general population. However, during pregnancy, additional contributing factors include high concentrations of sex hormones, fetal movement and pregnancy-associated physical discomfort. Iron and folate deficiency may contribute to restless legs syndrome. Most causes of pregnancy-related insomnia are relieved by childbirth.
Sleeping less than 6 hours a night has been associated with a longer labour and higher risk of caesarean section—treating insomnia may improve obstetric outcomes.
The approach to treating insomnia in the perinatal period is the same as for other patients—address factors impacting sleep, ensure the patient has good sleep practices and use psychological and behavioural interventions. If the patient is experiencing sleeping problems because of their infant’s sleeping patterns, see the Raising Children website for advice. If a drug is considered necessary to treat insomnia and the patient is:

Insomnia in an adult inpatient setting
Sleep disturbance is common among inpatients of healthcare facilities, particularly those in critical care. In addition to the usual contributing factors, loss of routine, displacement from usual sleeping environment and other environmental factors (eg noise, observation checks, excess light) can cause sleep problems. Opportunity to exercise is often limited and patients may nap during the day, further impacting on nocturnal sleep efficiency.
Improving sleep in inpatients follows the same principles as treating insomnia in the general population:
Short-term pharmacological therapy may be required if a patient is significantly distressed or impaired by insomnia—see When to use a drug for insomnia in adults. The risk of harm associated with drug use (eg sedation, falls, confusion) may be increased in a psychically unwell patient. If a drug is used for insomnia in the inpatient setting, reduce the dose and stop it before discharge. If this is not possible (eg the patient has been taking the hypnotic for several weeks), create a deprescribing plan to stop the drug in the community—see Insomnia in an adult who has taken a hypnotic long term.

Insomnia in an adult with problem substance use
Assessing and treating insomnia in an adult with alcohol or other drug problems can be complex.
In addition to the usual approach to assessment, determine how substance use is contributing to insomnia. Consider whether it is a short-term problem (eg related to a change in substance use, intoxication or withdrawal) or chronic—see Alcohol and other drug problems.
As for adults without problem substance use, pharmacological therapy has a limited role in treatment—see Principles of treating insomnia. Avoid using a hypnotic to treat insomnia in an adult with problem substance use because of the risk of further addiction and overdose. Hypnotic use may only be considered by clinicians with extensive experience in addiction medicine or in conjunction with a specialist in collaboration with local drug and alcohol services.

Insomnia in an adult who has taken a hypnotic long term
Many adults take hypnotics for prolonged periods and become dependent—this may occur after as little as 2 to 4 weeks of continuous hypnotic use. Problem long-term hypnotic use is especially prevalent among older people, even though they are most at risk of harm from hypnotics—see Hypnotic use in older people.
Avoid long-term hypnotic use—it is associated with daytime sedation, cognitive impairment, accidents, falls and hip fractures. The hypnotic efficacy of benzodiazepines appears to reduce within 4 weeks.
Regularly review patients who take long-term hypnotics—discuss and try to stop long-term hypnotic use whenever possible.
Stopping long-term hypnotic use requires:
Reconnexion is an Australian organisation that provides patients with information, support and counselling for benzodiazepine dependence, and information for healthcare professionals; see URL.
Consider referral to a specialist if the hypnotic cannot be successfully stopped without a relapse of insomnia (allowing for a period of rebound insomnia after stopping the drug)."
jet-lag,"Overview of jet lag
Jet lag is a temporary sleep disorder that commonly affects travellers who fly across several time zones. It is caused by a mismatch between the body’s circadian rhythm and the destination’s day–night cycle. Symptoms of jet lag include poor nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, malaise, cognitive impairment (eg reduced alertness and functioning) and gastrointestinal upset.
Jet lag is worsened by:
Typically, jet lag spontaneously resolves within a few days; however, it can be a serious impediment to professional performance and general functioning.

Interventions to prevent or reduce jet lag
Behavioural and pharmacological interventions may prevent or reduce jet lag. These interventions aim to:
The behavioural interventions recommended for jet lag are applicable to travellers of all ages, but pharmacological interventions are only suitable for adults.
The evidence for interventions to prevent or reduce jet lag is limited. Despite this, the behavioural interventions in Table 8.17 are recommended because they may be effective and are unlikely to cause harm.
Table 8.17 can be printed as a handout.
Adjustments
Before travel
starting 3 days before departure, shift both sleep and wake time by 30 minutes per day so that the sleep cycle more closely resembles the time zone at the final destination
Eastward travel:
Westward travel:
Inflight
set watch to destination time at the start of the flight
keep as physically active as possible during the daytime hours at the final destination
maintain adequate hydration by drinking water; avoid alcohol, tea and coffee
only sleep during night-time at the final destination; minimise disruptions by wearing ear plugs, an eye mask and layers of clothing to allow adjustment to temperature variation
On arrival at final destination
maximise exposure to sunlight during the day and establish a new routine of meals and activities (including exercise)
adults: consider drinking 1 to 3 caffeinated beverages in the morning to improve daytime alertness; avoid caffeine after midday at the new time zone because it can delay night-time sleep
delay sleep until night-time at the new time zone; if sleep deprived, take a short nap (up to 30 minutes) upon arrival at accommodation
remain in the dark during night-time in the new time zone, even if unable to sleep
In adults, immediate-release melatonin has evidence of benefit to prevent or reduce jet lag. Melatonin plays a central role in regulating circadian rhythms and can prevent or reduce jet lag in adults flying across 5 or more time zones, but may be useful if crossing more than 2 time zones. Immediate-release melatonin is not registered in Australia, but is available via the Special Access Scheme and from compounding pharmacies. To prevent or reduce jet lag in an adult, consider:
Avoid over-the-counter and internet-sourced melatonin formulations because the melatonin content in these preparations is unreliable. Although modified-release melatonin is registered in Australia for insomnia in adults aged 55 years or older, it is relatively ineffective for jetlag. If a suitable immediate-release melatonin formulation is not available, the modified-release formulation, taken 60 to 120 minutes on the plane before bedtime of the final destination and continued for up to 3 subsequent nights may be considered.
Avoid combining melatonin with other sedating drugs (eg hypnotics) to aid sleep; the benefits of this practice are unclear and it may cause further sedation.
Limited evidence suggests that hypnotics may reduce jet lag–related insomnia in adults; however, unlike melatonin, hypnotics do not help circadian phase shift. The modest potential benefits of hypnotics may be outweighed by their significant adverse effects including amnesia, confusion, dangerous sleep-related behaviours and risk of dependence. Hypnotic induced-immobility on the plane may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (ie deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE])—see below for further advice. If an adult wishes to take a hypnotic for acute insomnia associated with jet lag, assess the risk of misuse and discuss the limitations and harms of the hypnotic with them. Also advise the adult to avoid alcohol and other sedating drugs because combining a hypnotic with other sedatives increases the risk of central nervous system adverse effects.
If after discussing the potential benefits, harms and limitations of using a hypnotic for insomnia associated with jet lag, an adult wishes to take a hypnotic, consider zolpidem, zopiclone or temazepam. The regimens below are ranked in order of the quality and quantity of data to support their use in jet lag and their elimination half-lives—because of the limited opportunity to sleep on a flight, hypnotics with a quick onset of action and short half-life are preferred. Temazepam has the longest half-life and poorer quality data to support its use in jet lag. A suitable regimen is:
Immobility associated with hypnotics (or potentially, melatonin at high doses) may increase the risk of VTE. If a person at high risk of VTE wishes to take a hypnotic, they should not start it on the flight and instead start it on the first night at the final destination. For advice on VTE prophylaxis for long-distance travel (ie travel longer than 4 hours), see here.

major-depression,"Features of major depression
People with major depression typically have a low mood, loss of interest and enjoyment in activities, and other psychological and somatic symptoms. Other symptoms of major depression include:
In children, irritability may be a prominent symptom. Older people with depression may report atypical symptoms, including more physical symptoms and less sadness compared to younger people, although evidence is inconclusive. Psychotic symptoms, melancholic features (see below), insomnia, hypochondriasis and subjective memory complaints may also be more common in older people.
Major depression is diagnosed if a patient has at least 5 depressive symptoms for at least 2 weeks; and at least 1 of the symptoms is either depressed mood, or loss of interest or pleasure in activities.
Depressive symptoms are a feature of many disorders. Consider differential diagnoses in patients presenting with depressive symptoms—see Disorders that can cause depressive symptoms. Thoroughly assess patients with depressive symptoms, including an assessment of suicide risk.
Major depression can be classified as mild, moderate or severe.
Psychotic depression is a rare form of severe major depression in which patients experience psychotic symptoms (eg delusions of poverty, illness or guilt, hallucinations).
Major depression with melancholic features is a debated subtype of major depression that is particularly likely to respond to biological treatment (ie pharmacotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy). Patients tend to experience loss of pleasure in all or almost all activities, marked weight loss, a lack of reactivity of mood, and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people
Manage major depression in adults and young people with psychosocial interventions and, when required, drug treatment. For the approach to treating depression in people with dementia, see here.
At the time that depression is diagnosed, provide psychoeducation to the patient: discuss the diagnosis (including its natural history with and without treatment) with the patient and, if appropriate, their family, carers or significant others; identify acute or chronic stressors that can be addressed with psychosocial interventions; and explain the available treatments, the likelihood of response to treatment and possible adverse effects. Showing support and providing reassurance throughout the depressive episode can lessen feelings of hopelessness and encourage treatment adherence.
Psychoeducation should be accompanied by support to help the patient modify their lifestyle, if necessary. Lifestyle modification can include improving sleep hygiene, undertaking adequate physical activity (see below), consuming a healthy diet (see below), minimising alcohol consumption, reducing stress, and reviewing daily routines and social support.
Exercise is an effective treatment, either alone or as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions or pharmacotherapy for major depression [Note 1].
There is increasing evidence of a relationship between diet and mental health. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, cereals, legumes and fish) has been associated with a decreased risk of depression. Additionally, diets with high levels of processed foods have been found to contribute to depressive symptoms. Depression can influence eating habits. For example, patients with depression may restrict their eating or overeat in response to their symptoms. Hence, in addition to providing advice about the importance of a healthy and balanced diet, it can be helpful to enquire about patients’ specific eating habits and address any issues that may be contributing to their mental health issues [Note 2].
Implement simple psychosocial interventions in all patients with major depression.
Use a shared decision-making approach when discussing further treatment options (psychological therapies, antidepressants or both) with patients. Specific considerations for treating a young person with major depression are described below.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of pharmacological treatment, although suicide attempt rates remain lower than before treatment is started. Educate patients and, if appropriate, their family, carers or significant others about the risk of suicide, and monitor patients for suicide risk. For information on assessing suicide risk, see here.
Major depression is predominantly managed in primary care or community settings. However, treatment in hospital may be required for patients [Note 3]:
Home- or community-based support may be an alternative to treatment in hospital in some areas, dependent on the services available.
During remission of major depression, address factors that increase the risk of recurrent episodes, if possible. Educate patients and family, carers or significant others about how to identify early warning signs of a recurrent episode and develop a plan for early intervention. Most patients who have had an episode of major depression will experience more than one episode in their lifetime. If the patient has a recurrence of major depression, see Recurrent major depression in adults and young people for treatment.
Complementary medicines are commonly used by patients with major depression but their safety, quality and efficacy are not well established.
For considerations in treating a psychiatric disorder, including major depression, in a female of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For advice on treating perinatal depression (ie antenatal and postnatal depression, depression in partners), see here.

Principles of treating major depression in children
Principles of treating major depression in children are similar to those for adults and young people (see Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people); however:

Psychological therapies for major depression
For the indications for psychological therapy in major depression, see Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people or Principles of treating major depression in children.
If possible, use psychological therapy for all severities of major depression; for severe major depression and some cases of moderate major depression, psychological therapy is combined with an antidepressant.
For mild major depression, psychoeducation and simple psychological techniques such as structured problem solving or stress management are used. There is growing evidence for a range of internet-based structured psychotherapies (eg internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]), particularly in milder cases. The strongest evidence supports internet-based CBT when there is online access to a clinician to supplement the therapy when needed. Although clinician-delivered CBT from an appropriately trained clinician (eg psychologist, psychiatrist, other mental health professional) is preferred, internet-based CBT may be more accessible.
For moderate and severe major depression, referral to an appropriately trained clinician (eg psychologist, psychiatrist, other mental health professional) is recommended for psychological therapies, such as CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and brief psychodynamic psychotherapy. There is some evidence for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Internet-based CBT may be a useful adjunct but should not replace the supportive nature of the clinician–patient relationship.
Patients with severe persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment may benefit from psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia that focus on learning to adapt to the presence of ongoing symptoms (see Psychosocial interventions for psychoses including schizophrenia).
General practitioners trained in CBT can provide CBT to their patients. However, refer patients with more complex issues or patients not responding to treatment to an appropriately trained specialist (eg psychologist, psychiatrist, other mental health professional). Provide patients with information about the psychological therapy that will be used, as well as advice on less complex strategies (eg activity scheduling, relaxation strategies. If psychological therapy is provided by a psychologist, psychiatrist or other mental health practitioner, ensure a coordinated and collaborative treatment approach.
When using psychological interventions to treat major depression in children:

Approach to antidepressant therapy for major depression in adults and young people
For management of perinatal depression, see here.
For management of depression in people with dementia, see here.
For the indications for antidepressant therapy in major depression in adults and young people, see Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people.
There is a variable approach to initial antidepressant therapy for major depression in the literature and between guidelines. Network meta-analysis of currently available antidepressants demonstrated equivalent antidepressant efficacy overall with some differences in tolerability.
There is interindividual variability in response to available antidepressants and no way to predict which drug will be effective in a particular patient. Routine cytochrome P450 genotyping is not recommended for selecting or modifying antidepressant therapy.
The antidepressants outlined in Table 8.9 have been ranked as first, second and third line for the initial treatment of major depression in adults and young people, with consideration of their general tolerability and safety in overdose. If an antidepressant is indicated, initial choice should be informed by:
Antidepressant class
Drugs [NB1]
first-line therapy
SSRI
citalopram
escitalopram
fluoxetine
fluvoxamine
paroxetine
sertraline
tetracyclic antidepressant
mirtazapine
second-line therapy
SNRI
desvenlafaxine
duloxetine
venlafaxine
other
agomelatine
vortioxetine [NB2]
third-line therapy
reversible MAO
moclobemide
other
reboxetine
Adults with depression can experience insomnia, which often resolves when depression is treated (regardless of whether a sedating antidepressant is used). The principles of treating insomnia in adults with depression are the same as in adults without depression; drugs targeting insomnia alone have a limited role—see here. If a drug is required to treat insomnia, options for an adult with depression are to either use:
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mianserin and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are usually reserved for treatment-resistant depression and are ideally used under the guidance of a psychiatrist; however, they may be used first line for patients who have responded well to them previously (see Treatment-resistant major depression in adults for further information).
Do not use combinations of antidepressants first line for major depression because of the high risk of drug interactions. Although commonly used in practice, randomised controlled trials show that there is no benefit to combining mirtazapine with SSRIs or serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In treatment-resistant major depression, there is limited evidence for combining antidepressants.

Antidepressant regimens for major depression in adults and young people
If an antidepressant is indicated (see Principles of treating major depression), individualise the choice of antidepressant. Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Use:

Treating psychotic depression in adults and young people
Psychotic depression is a psychiatric emergency. Refer the patient for urgent treatment by a psychiatrist, specialist centre or mental health team. For the management of acute behavioural disturbance associated with psychotic depression, see here.
Psychiatrists may use a combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic for psychotic depression. There is limited evidence to guide choice of antipsychotic—antipsychotics with evidence as augmenting agents for major depression (eg aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine) or other antipsychotics can be used. Electroconvulsive therapy is an effective treatment for psychotic depression.

Initial pharmacotherapy for major depression in children
For the indications for antidepressant therapy in major depression in children, see Principles of treating major depression in children. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If pharmacotherapy is used, it should be combined with psychological therapy.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the preferred antidepressant class in children and individual SSRIs are likely to have similar effectiveness. There is a risk of developing agitation, activation and suicidal thoughts when starting treatment with any SSRI, particularly in the first 7 to 10 days. However, of the SSRIs, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with a greater risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours and other serious adverse events. Because there is more safety data for fluoxetine in children, it is the preferred SSRI. SSRIs are effective treatments for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, so may be particularly useful if there is a comorbid anxiety disorder. No SSRIs are approved to treat major depression in children in Australia.
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose initially may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation)—see Antidepressant adverse effects for information on managing adverse effects. This should be balanced against the time taken to achieve therapeutic concentrations of the antidepressant.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for major depression, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children, whereas the maximum doses approximate those used in adults and young people. In children 12 years and older, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for major depression, use:

Follow-up and duration of antidepressant therapy for major depression
Throughout antidepressant treatment, regularly assess the patient for response to treatment and adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to antidepressant treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.8). Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 to 2 weeks; full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks or longer. Approximately 60% of people with major depression respond to treatment with an initial antidepressant but only 40% will achieve full resolution of symptoms.
Because there is a high risk of relapse after a single episode of major depression, once an acceptable response is achieved, continue treatment for:
It is common for people with major depression to fail to respond to the first antidepressant used. Reinforce to the patient that a trial of more than one antidepressant may be required (given sequentially as monotherapy) before an acceptable response occurs. Inform the patient there is considerable interpatient variability in response to antidepressants. If psychological therapy has not been used, consider a trial, either alone or in combination with an antidepressant.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].
When switching antidepressants in adults or young people, the new drug can be from the same or a different class. For children, the antidepressant will necessarily be from the same class (ie an alternative SSRI). When changing from one antidepressant to another, refer to Switching antidepressants and Table 8.29.
If depressive symptoms persist despite using an effective dose of at least 2 antidepressants as sequential monotherapy, each for a minimum of 4 weeks, see Treatment-resistant major depression in adults and young people or Treatment-resistant major depression in children.

Treatment-resistant major depression in adults and young people
Treatment-resistant major depression is defined as depressive symptoms that persist despite using an effective dose of at least 2 antidepressants as sequential monotherapy, each for a minimum of 4 weeks. Consider if any of the reasons for antidepressant nonresponse listed in Box 8.30 could account for response; if not, refer patients with treatment-resistant major depression to a psychiatrist.
It is rarely appropriate to increase the antidepressant dose above the recommended maximum dose to try to overcome treatment resistance. Dosing above the recommended range is associated with increased adverse effects but may not improve symptoms because of the relatively flat dose-response curve of most antidepressants. However, rates of drug metabolism can vary depending on patient genetics (eg cytochrome p450 genotype) and drug interactions. In some cases, a psychiatrist may exceed the recommended dose range.
The choice of therapy for treatment-resistant major depression is influenced by patient-specific factors (eg severity of depression, comorbidities) and the availability of treatments. One of the following approaches may be considered by a psychiatrist:
At the time of writing, there are insufficient data to recommend routine use of ketamine or esketamine for major depression.
In patients with treatment-resistant major depression, psychiatrists may combine an antidepressant with one of the following drugs:
Irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (eg phenelzine, tranylcypromine) can be used under the supervision of a psychiatrist for patients with treatment-resistant major depression, or if the patient has responded well to them previously. However, use of MAOIs is restricted to specialists or practitioners familiar with managing the dietary restrictions and drug interactions (see Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]).
A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and close monitoring for postural dizziness using lying and standing blood pressure in the first 2 weeks and after dosage changes is recommended.
An appropriate regimen in adults and young people is:
Mianserin can be used under the supervision of a psychiatrist for patients with treatment-resistant major depression, or if the patient has responded well to it previously.
Mianserin has fewer cardiovascular and anticholinergic adverse effects and a wider margin of safety in overdose than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A full blood count is required before starting treatment and should be repeated at 4 to 6 weeks or if there are any clinical features suggestive of neutropenia (eg infection, sore throat).
An appropriate regimen in adults or young people is:
In patients with treatment-resistant major depression, psychiatrists may consider a physical therapy, such as:
Direct current stimulation (DCS) is a novel form of neurostimulation using noninvasive brain stimulation by transmitting a weak electrical current into brain tissue via electrodes to the scalp, which modulates neuronal firing. At the time of writing, there is insufficient evidence to recommend DCS for treatment-resistant major depression.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can be used under the supervision of a psychiatrist for patients with treatment-resistant major depression, or if the patient has responded well to them previously. TCAs have a role in the management of patients with severe or melancholic depression.
Some people are unable to tolerate the adverse effects of TCAs. Nortriptyline has a lower incidence of anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension and sedation than the other TCAs. Nortriptyline is the only TCA shown to have a dose-response curve based on blood concentrations, which is useful for titration or when adherence issues are suspected [Note 9] [Note 10]. TCAs are potentially lethal in overdose (see Tricyclic antidepressants in the Toxicology and Toxinology guidelines).
TCAs are generally less well tolerated in older people. However, if a TCA is well tolerated and effective in an older person, it is unnecessary to switch to another antidepressant; switching may cause a relapse, and is of particular concern in patients with a history of severe episodes, hospitalisation or suicide attempt.
A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and close monitoring for postural dizziness using lying and standing blood pressure in the first 2 weeks and after dosage changes is recommended.
An appropriate regimen in adults or young people is:
Low doses of intravenous ketamine significantly and rapidly decrease depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, there are insufficient data to recommend routine use of ketamine for treatment-resistant major depression.
Intranasal esketamine, a racemic isomer of ketamine, has demonstrated efficacy for treatment-resistant depression, but it is not licensed for use in Australia. Intranasal esketamine is approved for use in other countries as an adjunct to oral antidepressant therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Intranasal esketamine is not recommended because data on long-term maintenance of effect and safety are still in development.

In patients with treatment-resistant major depression, psychiatrists may combine an antidepressant with one of the following drugs:

Irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (eg phenelzine, tranylcypromine) can be used under the supervision of a psychiatrist for patients with treatment-resistant major depression, or if the patient has responded well to them previously. However, use of MAOIs is restricted to specialists or practitioners familiar with managing the dietary restrictions and drug interactions (see Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]).
A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and close monitoring for postural dizziness using lying and standing blood pressure in the first 2 weeks and after dosage changes is recommended.
An appropriate regimen in adults and young people is:

Mianserin can be used under the supervision of a psychiatrist for patients with treatment-resistant major depression, or if the patient has responded well to it previously.
Mianserin has fewer cardiovascular and anticholinergic adverse effects and a wider margin of safety in overdose than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A full blood count is required before starting treatment and should be repeated at 4 to 6 weeks or if there are any clinical features suggestive of neutropenia (eg infection, sore throat).

Treatment-resistant major depression in children
Treatment-resistant major depression is defined as depressive symptoms that persist despite using an effective dose of at least 2 antidepressants as sequential monotherapy, each for a minimum of 4 weeks. Consider if any of the reasons for antidepressant nonresponse listed in Box 8.30 could account for poor response; if not, refer the child to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input. Other antidepressants that may be considered by psychiatrists include tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); however, evidence of their efficacy is minimal and drugs from these classes are usually only used in adolescents.

Recurrent major depression in adults and young people
Most patients with major depression will experience more than one episode in their lifetime. Episodes that occur after having achieved full remission are referred to as recurrent episodes.
If the patient is not taking an antidepressant at the time of recurrence, treat the recurrent episode with the antidepressant that previously achieved remission; however, also consider the guidance on antidepressant choice here. Use the recommended starting dose (see Antidepressant regimens for major depression in adults and young people) and target the dose that previously achieved remission. The same dose provides greater protection from recurrence than using a reduced prophylactic dose.
If the recurrence occurs while the patient is taking an antidepressant, consider increasing the dose of antidepressant, which may help achieve remission of symptoms. If a dose increase is not possible, consider using a different antidepressant. See Antidepressant regimens for major depression in adults and young people or, if 2 or more antidepressants have been trialled, see Treatment-resistant major depression in adults and young people. When changing from one antidepressant to another, refer to Switching antidepressants.
If a patient has had 2 or more depressive episodes within 5 years, 3 or more cumulative episodes, psychotic depression or a serious suicide attempt, continue antidepressant therapy for 3 to 5 years—sometimes lifelong therapy is required.
Psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either alone or in conjunction with antidepressants, reduce the likelihood of depressive relapse. After acute treatment, 3-monthly ‘booster’ sessions with a psychologist during the first year of recovery can help prevent further relapse.
During remission, address factors that increase the risk of recurrent episodes, if possible. Educate patients and, if appropriate, their family, carers or significant others, on how to identify early warning signs of relapse and develop a plan for early intervention.
After the antidepressant course is complete, review the need for further management, taking into account any comorbid conditions and risk factors for further relapse. Some patients require lifelong antidepressant therapy.
Augmenting antidepressants with lithium reduces recurrences of major depression, especially for patients who experience recurrent depressive episodes while taking antidepressants. Augmentation with lithium is ideally initiated under the guidance of a psychiatrist. Combination treatment with an antidepressant and lithium may be required for long-term prophylaxis if prophylactic treatment with an antidepressant alone is inadequate.
There is a limited role for maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the specialist treatment of severe recurrent treatment-resistant depression.

Complementary medicines for major depression
Complementary medicines are commonly used by patients with major depression but their safety, quality and efficacy are not well established. In some instances, their use can lead to significant drug interactions or adverse effects. St John’s wort and omega-3 fatty acids have the most evidence of efficacy for major depression. Studies have shown that extracts of St John’s wort are effective for the treatment of mild to moderate major depression in adults. Omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in the treatment of major depression but there is not adequate evidence to support their routine use. For further information about alternative therapies for major depression, see Beyond Blue: A guide to what works for depression."
manic-episodes-bipolar-disorder,"Principles of managing acute mania in adults and young people
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of acute mania, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.
Before comprehensively assessing a person with manic symptoms, determine if they pose a threat to themselves or others. If there is a risk of harm, see Approach to managing acute behavioural disturbance.
Assessment of a patient with acute mania is best undertaken by a specialist—urgently refer people with manic symptoms to a psychiatrist or mental health service. Young people should ideally be referred to a youth mental health service such as Headspace, if available. For a first presentation of acute mania, psychiatrist review is particularly important to confirm the diagnosis; psychoeducation about bipolar disorder is also required.
Start treatment in liaison with a psychiatrist but do not delay treatment if prompt psychiatrist review is not available.
Determine the severity of mania symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms of mania usually have impaired insight and judgement, and risk causing significant harm to themselves or others (eg engaging in behaviour that damages their reputation, relationships or finances; aggression or physical harm to others). Determine whether the patient has engaged in uncharacteristic behaviour and help them to address any consequences of this behaviour.
Patients with severe symptoms of mania who are a danger to themselves or others require urgent treatment in hospital [Note 1]. The primary aim of treatment is to curb disturbed behaviour (eg aggression, violence, agitation, overactivity, disinhibition)—an antipsychotic is used to rapidly achieve this. Additional intervention may be required to calm patients who are severely agitated, or are behaving in a threatening or aggressive manner. Start lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine simultaneously with the antipsychotic. See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people for more detail and drug regimens. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe acute mania.
Patients with less severe symptoms of mania also require prompt treatment but may not need to be hospitalised. Treatment in the community is preferred and may be delivered by a community mental health team, a shared-care program with the treating psychiatrist and general practitioner, or an outpatient program. Link patients to an acute specialist treatment team (eg crisis assessment and treatment team). Start combination therapy with an antipsychotic (to rapidly reduce the symptoms of mania), and lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine (for maintenance therapy). See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adutls and young people for more detail and drug regimens.
In addition to starting pharmacological treatment, immediately stop or rapidly reduce any drug the patient is currently taking that has mood-elevating properties (eg antidepressant, stimulant).
Once acute mania has stabilised, offer relevant psychosocial interventions. Optimised multimodal therapy and an adequate duration of drug therapy can prevent recurrent episodes, which are associated with worse long-term outcomes. Poor treatment adherence can lead to relapse or recurrent episodes; check blood drug concentrations where relevant [Note 2] [Note 3]. Other common causes of recurrence or relapse include substance abuse, antidepressant use, stressful life events and sleep deprivation. Some patients will relapse in the absence of any of these factors. If relapse occurs, treat according to the mood episode and consider the need for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, in consultation with the patient’s psychiatrist.
See also the additional considerations:

Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people
See Principles of managing acute mania in adults and young people for advice on the setting in which initial treatment should be delivered, the requirement for psychiatrist oversight and an overview of management. Involuntary treatment is often necessary [Note 4].
An antipsychotic is the most effective drug for rapidly reducing symptoms of acute mania but is usually stopped once acute mania remits because lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine are preferred for maintenance therapy. Lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine is started in parallel with an antipsychotic, which may enhance resolution of the acute mania. Additional short-term pharmacotherapy may be needed for patients with severe agitation or threatening and aggressive behaviour.
The pharmacological treatment of acute mania is summarised in Table 8.5.
Review response to treatment every 2 to 3 days. Agitation, difficulty sleeping and aggressive behaviour often start to settle within a few days, while the underlying elevated or irritable mood and any associated psychotic features may take up to a month to resolve. If there is no response to initial treatment, or the treatment response is inadequate, seek expert advice (see also Nonresponse to treatment for acute mania).
Simultaneously monitor the tolerability of treatment—tolerability is an important consideration because drug therapy is usually prolonged.
Consider contraindications, precautions, adverse effects, dosage adjustments, clinical monitoring requirements before and during therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring [Note 5] [Note 6]. For the principles of antipsychotic use, see here. Consult a drug information source for other drugs.
After acute mania has resolved and the patient is euthymic (ie has a stable mental state that is neither manic nor depressed), monotherapy with lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine for maintenance therapy is preferred—follow the psychiatrist’s treatment plan for stopping the antipsychotic and any adjunctive pharmacotherapy for agitation.
Use maintenance therapy for at least 6 months after a first manic episode, then assess whether prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required. If stopping a drug, liaise with a psychiatrist about how to do so.

Antipsychotics for acute mania in adults and young people
See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people for the role of antipsychotics in the treatment of mania, as well as advice on assessing efficacy and tolerability and use in specific populations (eg pregnant people, young people).
For patients with sufficient insight and awareness, discuss the following with them and, if they consent, their family, carers or significant others:
Antipsychotic choice must balance efficacy and tolerability (consider both short- and long-term adverse effects). For drugs with similar efficacy, choice should be guided by the adverse effect profile and whether these are acceptable to the patient. Also consider the availability of a long-acting injectable formulation. Young people in particular are at risk of antipsychotic adverse effects including extrapyramidal adverse effects, effects due to elevated blood prolactin concentration, and weight gain.
Of the antipsychotics listed below, olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol are the most effective antipsychotics for initial treatment of acute mania. The use of haloperidol is limited by its association with extrapyramidal adverse effects.
Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40. Dosage should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for adverse effects). Slower dose escalation may be required for people who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects.
If adverse effects are suspected, lower the dose or switch to another drug with a lower propensity for adverse effects—see Switching antipsychotics.
For initial treatment of acute mania, use one of the following antipsychotics, concurrently with lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine. Use:
If daytime sedation is an issue with once-daily doses, give the dose at night.
If there is no response to treatment within a few weeks, see Nonresponse to treatment for acute mania.
If there is an acceptable response, continue combination therapy until acute symptoms have remitted, then follow the psychiatrist’s treatment plan for stopping the antipsychotic. Continue with lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine as monotherapy for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.

Lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine for acute mania in adults and young people
See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people for the role of lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine in the maintenance treatment of mania and use in specific populations (eg pregnant people, young people).
Lithium is the most effective drug for preventing relapse of mania. Sodium valproate and carbamazepine are not as effective as lithium as maintenance treatments—carbamazepine has less data than sodium valproate and is associated with significant adverse effects.
Consult a drug information source for advice on contraindications, precautions, adverse effects, dosage adjustments, clinical monitoring requirements before and during therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring [Note 10] [Note 11].
For maintenance treatment of mania, use one of the following drugs, concurrently with an antipsychotic for acute mania. Use:
If there is no response to treatment within a few weeks, see Nonresponse to treatment for acute mania.
If there is an acceptable response, continue treatment for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.

Treating agitation in adults and young people with acute mania
Agitation is a common symptom of acute mania that varies in duration and severity, ranging from mild (eg pacing, fidgeting) to severe (eg uncooperative, threatening or aggressive behaviours). If initial treatment with an antipsychotic plus lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine is not effective in managing agitation, further intervention may be required.
If a patient with mania is acutely agitated, only provide treatment if it is safe and appropriate to do so. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm.
If a patient with acute mania remains agitated but is willing to accept an oral drug, consider using a suitable dose of the patient’s antipsychotic or adding a benzodiazepine. Drug choice is influenced by current treatment, previous response, severity of agitation and patient factors. An antipsychotic is preferred for more severe agitation; however, there are few data to support ‘as needed’ (prn) administration of antipsychotics, and it can worsen agitation and increase the risk of adverse effects (eg akathisia). For a first episode of mania, it may be preferable to use a benzodiazepine to minimise exposure to antipsychotics; however, high doses of benzodiazepines can cause delirium, which can cause or worsen agitation.
See the additional considerations in drug choice:
If a benzodiazepine is preferred, use:
When selecting a suitable benzodiazepine dose, consider patient factors, such as level of agitation, body size, age, sex, comorbidities, treatment setting, drug history, previous response to sedative drugs and response to treatment. Modest benzodiazepine doses should be used initially in patients treated in the community, particularly in those who are benzodiazepine naïve.
If an antipsychotic is preferred, use a suitable dose of the patient’s antipsychotic as required, but do not exceed the maximum daily dose of the antipsychotic (including regular doses). After the agitation has resolved, do not continue the antipsychotic at the increased dose to manage mania.
If the patient remains acutely agitated and at risk of harming themselves or others 30 to 60 minutes after the administration of the benzodiazepine or antipsychotic, or if the patient will not accept an oral drug, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for further advice.
Consult a psychiatrist to consider zuclopenthixol acetate if the patient has any of the following features:
If recurrent agitation and aggression is likely to continue for the next 2 to 3 days, if appropriate, a psychiatrist may use:
Zuclopenthixol acetate has an onset of action within 2 hours and the peak effect is achieved approximately 24 hours after administration. Patients should be monitored after receiving zuclopenthixol acetate.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics for maintenance therapy after acute mania
See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people for the role of antipsychotics in the maintenance treatment of mania.
Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are not commonly used in bipolar disorder. However, they may be useful for maintenance therapy (either as monotherapy or combined with another drug) in patients who prefer to use them or refuse to take oral drugs after acute mania has resolved—for the advantages and disadvantages of long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulations compared to oral antipsychotic formulations, see Table 8.21.
A long-acting injectable antipsychotic should be started in consultation with the patient’s psychiatrist or mental health team, and managed by a practitioner experienced in their use.
Of the antipsychotics available as a long-acting injectable formulation, aripiprazole or risperidone is preferred because there is some evidence for their use in bipolar disorder. Avoid long-acting injectable haloperidol and olanzapine because of the risk of serious adverse effects—see Antipsychotic adverse effects for more detail.
When starting a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, it is preferable to use an antipsychotic that the patient has tolerated in oral form and, ideally, has responded to and is stabilised on (ie taken for at least 2 weeks). This:
If the patient takes an oral antipsychotic other than aripiprazole or risperidone, first switch to one of those drugs to establish tolerability.
When choosing between aripiprazole and risperidone, discuss antipsychotic choice with the patient and, if they consent, their family, carers or significant others using the discussion points here.
Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40. Dosage should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for adverse effects). Dose titration of long-acting injectable antipsychotics should be guided by a psychiatrist.
An appropriate regimen of a long-acting antipsychotic for bipolar disorder in adults and young people is:

Pharmacological treatment of acute mania during pregnancy
The management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy is complex—see Principles of treating bipolar disorder during pregnancy for advice on determining treatment approach.
The recommendations in this section are intended for a first episode of acute mania during pregnancy but can be used to guide drug choice if drug therapy needs to be changed in a patient with existing bipolar disorder.
If an episode of acute mania occurs during pregnancy, urgently seek psychiatric advice. Depending on the severity of the episode and the pregnancy trimester, monotherapy is usually preferred to reduce potential harms to the fetus associated with polypharmacy.
Throughout pregnancy, but particularly in the first trimester, monotherapy with an antipsychotic may be preferred—olanzapine, risperidone or quetiapine have the most pregnancy safety data; see also Antipsychotic use during pregnancy.
Only start lithium in the first trimester if the patient does not respond to antipsychotic therapy because of the increased (although low) risk of congenital malformations with its use. Lithium therapy can be started from the second trimester onwards but should not be used with concurrent breastfeeding. For advice on lithium use during pregnancy, see here and breastfeeding, see here.
Carbamazepine can be used from the second trimester, but should not be used in the first trimester—see Sodium valproate or carbamazepine use during pregnancy.
Do not start sodium valproate during pregnancy—see Sodium valproate or carbamazepine use during pregnancy.
Drug choice is also influenced by the patient’s desire to breastfeed—see Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.

Nonresponse to treatment of acute mania in adults and young people
If the patient has an inadequate response to pharmacotherapy for acute mania within a few weeks, address any factors in Box 8.17 that could account for the response.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to pharmacological treatment of acute mania or has a relapse.
If alternative reasons for treatment failure have been discounted, other treatment strategies that a psychiatrist may use include:

Principles of managing acute mania in children
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of acute mania, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children.
Acute mania is extremely rare in children and treatment should always be provided by a service with practitioners experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children. Treatment in hospital is usually necessary.
Principles of treating acute mania in children are similar to those for adults and young people but there is less evidence to support the efficacy of the interventions in children."
mental-health-disorders-following-trauma,"Overview of mental health disorders following trauma exposure
Exposure to a traumatic event commonly results in psychological distress. Events that pose an actual or perceived threat to the life or physical safety of the person, or others around them, can be traumatic; examples include war, physical or sexual assault, kidnap, terrorist attacks, torture, natural disasters and severe motor vehicle accidents. A miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or difficult childbirth or pregnancy can also be traumatic, especially in people with a history of sexual trauma.
Psychological symptoms of distress usually settle in the days to weeks following the traumatic event but a minority of people have persisting symptoms and develop acute stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Acute stress disorder is characterised by significant distress or functional impairment after a traumatic event. Symptoms last for more than 2 days but less than 1 month and, in most people, spontaneously remit. Intrusion (persistent re-experience of the traumatic event), marked dissociation, avoidance and heightened arousal are common.
PTSD is characterised by intrusion, persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event, negative thoughts or feelings, and marked alterations in reactivity and arousal (eg irritability, aggression, difficulty concentrating). Symptoms last for more than 1 month. A diagnosis of delayed-expression PTSD is made if symptoms first occur more than 6 months after exposure.
Suspected acute stress disorder or PTSD in a child should be evaluated using a developmentally informed approach. Symptoms in children may include withdrawal, disruptive behaviours, inattention, nightmares, or repeated play with themes or re-enactment of the traumatic event. Symptoms in children 6 years or younger can also include regressive behaviours, excessive tantrums, crying, clinginess or immobility. The impact of a traumatic event on a child can be influenced by their caregiver’s reaction to the trauma and ability to provide support.
People with acute stress disorder or PTSD commonly have comorbid problem substance use, or major depression; these comorbidities require treatment. Somatic complaints may also be experienced.
People with PTSD associated with childbirth or pregnancy may avoid their infants, which can cause problems with emotional regulation in the infant. PTSD related to childbirth or pregnancy may also lead to avoidance of sexual activity and a fear of further childbearing (tocophobia).
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as acute stress disorder and PTSD in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Early interventions following trauma exposure
Offer adults and young people who have been exposed to trauma practical and emotional support, encourage them to use coping strategies and access social supports, and provide advice on good sleep practices. More detail can be found in the Mental Health First Aid Australia guidelines. Routine structured interventions (eg psychological debriefing) are no longer recommended following trauma exposure. Pharmacotherapy does not have any role in the prevention of acute or posttraumatic stress disorder.
Closely but unobtrusively monitor the patient’s recovery. Symptoms remit spontaneously in the vast majority of people and intervention is not necessary. However, consider psychosocial interventions if symptoms persist for 1 month or more, or earlier if the person is at risk of developing PTSD (eg past history of trauma, exposure to additional stressors after the traumatic event).
Early interventions in children are similar to those in adults and young people, but should be tailored to the child’s developmental stage.

Psychosocial interventions for acute or posttraumatic stress disorder in adults and young people
Trauma-focused psychosocial interventions are effective for both acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Start psychosocial interventions, including psychoeducation, in:
Psychosocial interventions with the best evidence include:
There is also limited evidence for dialectical behaviour therapy, emotion-focused therapy, metacognitive therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.
If PTSD follows exposure to prolonged or severe traumatic events, teaching emotional regulation skills and a more gradual approach to exposure therapy may be required.
Exposure-based therapies have limited benefit in delayed-expression PTSD; instead, psychosocial interventions that help the patient manage their symptoms (eg anger and anxiety management, stress reduction, relaxation therapy, good sleep practices) are used.

Psychosocial interventions for acute or posttraumatic stress disorder in children
Psychosocial interventions for acute or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children should be administered by a specialist. There is no evidence that one type of therapy is more effective than others.
For school-aged or older children, developmentally appropriate trauma-focused behavioural interventions (delivered as individual therapy) are first line. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a structured, short-term intervention that helps the patient come to terms with their trauma through exposure to, and emotional processing of, memories of the event. It can involve a family-based component to support positive parenting, and help the parent or carer support the child’s practice of CBT.
Other interventions such as eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) may be considered for patients who do not benefit from or engage in trauma-focused behaviour interventions.
In younger-than-school-aged children, other specialist-administered therapies may be considered by a PTSD expert.

Initial pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults and young people
Psychosocial interventions are first line for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults and young people. Pharmacotherapy may be used as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions, or as an alternative when psychosocial interventions are unavailable, not effective or not preferred.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as PTSD during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.
For patients presenting during an acute crisis, if possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated and is at risk of harming themselves or others, see the advice on drug therapy for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or older people.
If an antidepressant is indicated for PTSD, initial choice should be informed by:
There is evidence for the SSRIs fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline in PTSD but comparative trials are lacking. There is also some evidence for venlafaxine, a serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but patients with PTSD may be particularly sensitive to its adverse effects. Although there are no data for other SSRIs and SNRIs, they are likely to have similar effectiveness.
If an SSRI or SNRI is considered appropriate for PTSD, individualise the choice of drug (see above). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Use:

Follow-up and duration of pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to antidepressant treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.9). Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after several weeks; full benefit may take 8 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant.

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults and young people
Consider modifying treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults and young people if symptoms persist despite:
Options for treatment modification include:
There is limited evidence to support the use of mirtazapine and TCAs. Intolerance commonly limits the use of TCAs and toxicity in overdose must be considered. Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information.
If mirtazapine or a TCA is considered appropriate for PTSD in an adult or a young person, use:
Phenelzine is reserved for use by specialists, or practitioners familiar with managing associated dietary restrictions and drug interactions (see Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information.
If phenelzine is considered appropriate for treatment-resistant PTSD, a suitable regimen is:
Psychiatrists may combine an antidepressant with risperidone or olanzapine for treatment-resistant PTSD. The greatest benefit is seen for intrusive symptoms. However, there is limited evidence supporting this practice and the adverse effects of antipsychotics should be considered.
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as PTSD in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Posttraumatic stress disorder–associated nightmares in adults and young people
Recurrent nightmares featuring a repeated story are commonly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatment may include psychosocial interventions such as imagery rehearsal therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy.
Prazosin has been used to improve PTSD–associated nightmares and sleep disturbance, but evidence is conflicting. If prazosin is considered appropriate for PTSD–associated nightmares, a suitable regimen is:
Other drugs with limited evidence for PTSD–associated nightmares include clonidine, olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, cyproheptadine, fluvoxamine, gabapentin, phenelzine, topiramate and tricyclic antidepressants. These drugs may be trialled by a psychiatrist.

Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in children
Psychosocial interventions are first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children, and pharmacotherapy should not be used routinely. Pharmacotherapy may be considered as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions for children with severe symptoms that prevent engagement with psychosocial intervention (eg severe anxiety, fear or hopelessness). Seek expert advice if pharmacotherapy is considered.
Pharmacotherapy may also be necessary for children with comorbid major depression or an anxiety disorder; a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is usually the drug of choice.
If the child has symptoms of a panic attack, treat accordingly (see Panic attack)."
obsessive-compulsive-disorder,"Overview of obsessive compulsive disorder
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted. In most people, obsessions cause marked anxiety or distress. The person usually attempts to ignore or suppress these thoughts, impulses or images, or to counter them by performing a compulsion. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours (eg hand washing, checking) or mental acts (eg counting) that the person feels compelled to undertake in response to an obsession in order to prevent discomfort, or a dreaded event that the compulsion cannot realistically affect. The person usually recognises that their behaviour is excessive or unreasonable.
The obsessions or compulsions can significantly interfere with the person’s life and can impact people living or working with them.
The lifetime prevalence of OCD is 2 to 2.5%. Childhood OCD occurs in the same form as that seen in adults and usually manifests between 5 and 15 years.

Obsessive compulsive disorder during the perinatal period
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can be particularly challenging during the perinatal period.
Antenatal OCD can cause significant distress and poorer perinatal outcomes. Specific behaviours may affect the pregnancy (eg obsessions about contaminated food may lead to restricted eating and malnutrition). OCD is more prevalent among pregnant females than those who are not pregnant; up to 40% of females who develop OCD experience its onset during pregnancy.
Postnatal OCD can impair a parent’s ability to care for their infant.
Thoughts of intentional infant harm (eg physical or sexual abuse) are distressing but common after a person gives birth. Most people dismiss such thoughts but people with OCD may obsess over them and become concerned about unwillingly acting upon them. This can lead them to experience feelings of extreme guilt and fear, and worry that they want to harm their infant or there is ‘something wrong with them’.
If a person expresses thoughts of harming their infant, determine whether there is a risk of infant harm (eg the patient has delusions that could indicate postpartum psychosis and potential for infanticide or suicide; the patient expresses definite intent). Mothers with OCD rarely pose a risk of harm to their infant. Thoughts of infant harm are likely to be associated with OCD if the mother:
Respond to thoughts of infant harm tactfully. If the thoughts are obviously related to OCD and reflect anxiety rather than risk of infant harm, provide the patient and, if they consent, their partner with reassurance and psychoeducation. Overreacting (eg by reporting a patient with OCD to child protection services or not allowing them to be alone with their infant) can worsen OCD, disrupt the family and impair parent–infant attachment. Comorbid severe depression, psychosis, substance use disorders and reduced impulse control (eg personality disorder) pose a higher risk of infant harm. Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist, particularly if the risk of harm to the infant is uncertain. If the risk of harm seems high, consider an urgent psychiatric assessment (eg by a community mental health team, in an emergency department).
People who experience postnatal obsessional thoughts about their infant may not have OCD—almost half of patients with postnatal depression have such thoughts.
For additional considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as OCD in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Approach to managing obsessive compulsive disorder in adults and young people
Adults and young people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) may be best managed by a psychiatrist. Combining psychosocial and pharmacological treatments is usually associated with the best response.
Psychosocial interventions are first line but some patients require initial pharmacotherapy to actively engage in psychosocial interventions. Pharmacotherapy can also be used as an adjunct to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with an exposure and response prevention (ExRP) component.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For advice on OCD during the perinatal period, see here. For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as OCD in partners during the perinatal period, see here.

Approach to managing obsessive compulsive disorder in children
Use psychosocial interventions (adapted to chronological and developmental age) first line for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children. Psychoeducation should involve providing a clear explanation of OCD to the child and their family, carers or significant others.
Children with severe OCD may not respond to psychosocial interventions; concurrent pharmacotherapy may be required. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children.

Psychosocial interventions for obsessive compulsive disorder
Use psychosocial interventions first line for the management of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Initial treatment includes psychoeducation. Because symptoms frequently impact people living or working with the person with OCD, psychoeducation and support for family, carers or significant others are also important.
Many patients, particularly those with more severe symptoms, cannot engage in psychosocial interventions until they have an initial response to pharmacotherapy.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with an exposure and response prevention (ExRP) component is the treatment of choice. This includes 2 key elements: exposure to the cues or triggers that cause anxiety and strategies to prevent acting on compulsions. For children, adapt CBT to their chronological and developmental age.
There is also limited evidence for acceptance and commitment therapy, family intervention and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.

Initial pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults and young people
Follow the approach to managing obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in adults and young people. Psychosocial interventions are first-line treatment for OCD.
If an antidepressant is indicated for OCD in an adult or young person, initial choice should be informed by:
SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) are first-line drugs for OCD. There is limited evidence supporting the use of serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine), but they are an option if the patient has a poor response to, or does not tolerate, SSRIs.
Often the doses of SSRIs and SNRIs required to effectively treat OCD are higher than the doses for other indications. If using a dose in the upper range of those recommended below, the patient must be monitored for adverse effects, including with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Because the risk of QT-interval prolongation appears to be higher with citalopram compared to other SSRIs, the maximum recommended dose of citalopram is comparatively lower than the maximum doses of other SSRIs.
Many patients relapse when antidepressants are withdrawn, so require long-term pharmacotherapy.
If an SSRI or SNRI is considered appropriate for obsessive compulsive disorder, individualise the choice of drug (see above). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Use:

Initial pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in children
Follow the approach to managing obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children. Psychosocial interventions are first line for OCD. Consider pharmacotherapy if there is insufficient response to psychosocial interventions, or symptoms are severe and causing significant impairment. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use it concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line drugs; however, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events.
OCD symptoms can worsen after starting drug therapy and many patients do not experience symptom relief for 4 to 8 weeks—provide support and close monitoring during this time.
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for OCD in children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for OCD, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), seek expert advice—the doses of SSRIs required to effectively treat OCD are often higher than the doses for other indications. In children 12 years and older, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for OCD, use:

Follow-up and duration of pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.4). Response to treatment may become apparent after several weeks; full benefit may take 8 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults and young people
Consider modifying treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in an adult or young person if symptoms persist despite:
Options for treatment modification include:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as OCD during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.
Clomipramine may be uniquely effective for some patients, but intolerance commonly limits its use and toxicity in overdose must be considered. Use lower doses in frail or older people. Clomipramine can cause changes in cardiac conduction—an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained before treatment is started and repeated once the dose is stabilised, usually after 6 weeks. If either ECG shows abnormalities, seek advice from a cardiologist before starting or continuing treatment. If clomipramine is considered appropriate for OCD, use:
Psychiatrists may combine an antidepressant with low-dose aripiprazole or risperidone for treatment-resistant OCD. However, there is limited evidence supporting this practice and the adverse effects of antipsychotics should be considered.

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in children
Consider modifying treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children if symptoms persist despite all of the following:
Options for treatment modification include:
Clomipramine should only be started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. Intolerance commonly limits the use of clomipramine and toxicity in overdose must be considered. Clomipramine can cause changes in cardiac conduction—an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained before treatment is started and repeated once the dose is stabilised, usually after 6 weeks. If either ECG shows abnormalities, seek advice from a paediatric cardiologist before starting or continuing treatment.
Do not use clomipramine in children younger than 10 years.
If clomipramine is considered appropriate for OCD in children 10 years and older, clinicians with appropriate expertise may use:
Response usually occurs 4 to 10 weeks after reaching an effective dose.
Psychiatrists may use an antipsychotic as an augmenting agent in children with concurrent tics and OCD. However, there is limited evidence supporting this practice and the adverse effects of antipsychotics should be considered."
off-label-prescribing-psychiatric-disorders,"Off-label prescribing for psychiatric disorders
‘Off-label prescribing’ refers to prescription of a registered medicine outside the licensed indication(s) in the product information. This may be for a condition, age range, dosage or route of administration that is different to that approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).
Off-label prescribing is common for psychiatric disorders. Approved indications may be more restrictive than the range of conditions or doses for which evidence is available to guide practice; often the product information of older drugs may not reflect accepted use in practice. Off-label prescribing is especially common when treating children and pregnant patients because limited clinical data is available in these patient groups.
Recommendations in these guidelines reflect careful consideration of the clinical evidence, current practices and the adverse effects of drugs. Off-label recommendations have been included for an indication when the medicine is considered to be a safe and effective treatment.
It is important to discuss off-label use of a medicine with the patient to explain the rationale for use. In line with good clinical practice, obtain informed consent before prescribing off label. Monitor physiological and psychological indices of adverse effects and therapeutic outcomes in patients taking off-label medicines. Document off-label use in the patient’s records and advise the patient that consumer information may not include information about unapproved uses.
Prescribers should be able to justify off-label use of a medicine with evidence and be confident in its use. If a psychiatrist prescribes off label, it is important to communicate this to the general practitioner and provide advice on the duration of treatment and any ongoing monitoring requirements.
For further information on off-label prescribing for psychiatric disorders, see the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Professional Practice guideline 4: ‘Off-label’ prescribing in psychiatry."
orthorexia-nervosa,"Orthorexia nervosa
Orthorexia nervosa is a term used to describe a disorder that is characterised by an obsession with healthy eating and a focus on food quality or purity—this can result in malnutrition, weight loss or impairment in daily functioning. Orthorexia nervosa is not a formally recognised disorder—there is no accepted definition or diagnostic criteria and evidence for management of the disorder is very limited.
People with orthorexia nervosa may meet criteria for another eating disorder—for management see:
It is not clear what management options are effective for orthorexia nervosa. Psychological treatment such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) used for other eating disorders may be trialled. Educating patients about correct nutritional information may help.

other-specified-unspecified-feeding-eating-disorder,"Overview of other specified or unspecified feeding or eating disorder
Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) is a diagnostic category encompassing eating disorders that do not meet criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder; however, people with the disorder experience similar levels of impairment in health-related quality of life. OSFED subtypes include:
Unspecified feeding or eating disorder (UFED) is a diagnostic category that applies to presentations that do not fulfil specific diagnostic criteria. Instead, clinical judgement is used to recognise there is a disorder present.
Useful resources are available from:

Atypical anorexia nervosa
Patients with atypical anorexia nervosa meet all the criteria for anorexia nervosa but are not considered to be underweight (eg body mass index (BMI) above 18.5 kg/m2) despite significant weight loss.
The approach to managing atypical anorexia nervosa is similar to the approach taken for anorexia nervosa. However, rather than promoting weight gain (which is the focus of anorexia nervosa treatment), aim to stop further weight loss.

Subthreshold bulimia nervosa
People with subthreshold bulimia nervosa meet all the criteria for bulimia nervosa, except their symptoms last for a shorter duration (ie less than 3 months) and purging behaviours occur at a lower frequency (ie less than once weekly).
Manage patients with subthreshold bulimia nervosa the same as those with bulimia nervosa.

Subthreshold binge eating disorder
People with subthreshold binge eating disorder meet all the criteria for the binge eating disorder, except their symptoms last for a shorter duration (ie less than 3 months) and binge eating occurs at a lower frequency (ie less than once weekly).
Manage patients with subthreshold binge eating disorder the same as those with binge eating disorder.

Purging disorder
People with purging disorder have recurrent purging behaviours that are similar to those in bulimia nervosa (eg self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse); however, this is not accompanied by regular binge eating. Subjective binge eating (perceived overeating of small or normal food portions) may be present.
Purging disorder is managed similarly to bulimia nervosa. Monitor patients for medical complications, notably dehydration and metabolic disturbances of purging behaviours. Use the same psychological treatment as for bulimia nervosa. For patients who have not responded to psychological treatment alone or if there is difficulty in accessing the treatment, specialists may use pharmacological treatment as recommended for binge eating disorder.

Night-eating syndrome
Night-eating syndrome is characterised by binge-eating episodes (uncontrolled overeating) that occur during the night while the patient is awake and in a state of full alertness. People with night-eating syndrome may present with sleep deprivation and daytime fatigue because their sleep is disrupted.
Management of night-eating syndrome is similar to that for binge eating disorder. Use the same psychological treatments as for binge eating disorder. For patients who have not responded to psychological treatment alone or if there is difficulty in accessing the treatment, specialists may use pharmacological treatment as recommended for binge eating disorder.

Unspecified feeding or eating disorder
Unspecified feeding or eating disorder (UFED) is a diagnosis made in a patient that is clinically recognised to have an eating disorder, but does not fulfil specific diagnostic criteria for other eating disorders. This can include people with excessive body image concerns, those who engage in extreme levels of exercise to reduce their body weight, or people with other extreme and repetitive behaviours perceived to reduce body weight (eg chewing and spitting).
Consider starting treatment if the patient’s daily functioning is impaired. The management approach used depends on the type of behaviours present. Use a management approach from an eating disorder that has similar behaviours. See:"
overview-anxiety-disorders,"Assessing a person with anxiety
Anxiety is an emotional state that is part of the general human condition. It can be useful in focusing attention during times of perceived threats (internal or external), stimulating appropriate and adaptive responses and ultimately improving function. If the anxiety becomes prolonged, excessive or out of proportion to the stimulus it can become maladaptive and impair function, becoming clinically significant.
Anxiety disorders are patterns of anxiety symptoms and signs that form syndromes with specific aetiology, clinical course, and response to treatments, and can be separated into a number of discrete conditions (see Box 8.8).

Mental health disorders following trauma exposure:
Comorbidity frequently exists between the different anxiety disorders, mood disorders and problem substance use. Anxiety is common during the perinatal period, including in partners, and is often associated with depression [Note 1].
Anxiety disorders can be difficult to diagnose. People may be hesitant to seek help because of embarrassment, a lack of awareness, or a misconception that their symptoms reflect flaws in their character rather than a treatable condition.
Patients with anxiety can have physical symptoms of anxiety (eg chest pain) and assume they are caused by another underlying condition. Careful examination, assessment and reassurance may reduce these anxiety symptoms.
Assess patients presenting with anxiety symptoms. The aim of assessing a patient with anxiety symptoms is to aid diagnosis, detect comorbid conditions and establish a robust patient–clinician relationship, which is central to the success of treatment.
When assessing a patient with anxiety symptoms:
Consider differential diagnoses and comorbid conditions—anxiety symptoms can be caused by an anxiety disorder, or be secondary to other psychiatric disorders (eg major depression) or, less commonly, medical conditions (eg hyperthyroidism).
If an anxiety disorder is suspected, specific questioning will help clarify the type of anxiety disorder, for example:
If a somatic symptom disorder (hypochondriasis) is suspected, use health anxiety screening questions; for example:
When assessing a child with anxiety symptoms, also consider that:

Managing anxiety and associated disorders in adults and young people
Manage an anxiety disorder in adults and young people with psychosocial interventions and, when required, drug treatment.
At the time that an anxiety disorder is diagnosed, provide psychoeducation to the patient: discuss the diagnosis (including its natural history with and without treatment) with the patient and, if appropriate, their family, carers or significant others; identify acute or chronic stressors that can be addressed with psychosocial interventions; and explain the available treatments, the likelihood of response to treatment and possible adverse effects. Showing support and providing reassurance can lessen anxiety symptoms and encourage treatment adherence.
Psychoeducation should be accompanied by support to help the patient modify their lifestyle, if necessary. Lifestyle modification can include improving sleep hygiene, undertaking adequate physical activity (see below), consuming a healthy diet (see below), minimising alcohol and caffeine consumption, reducing stress, reviewing daily routines and encouraging social support.
Exercise may be a helpful adjunct for people experiencing anxiety [Note 2]; exercise may decrease panic symptoms by lowering a person’s sensitivity to internal symptoms that are similar to panic, and their sensitivity to carbon dioxide (which plays a role in inducing anxiety symptoms).
Anxiety can affect eating habits (eg patients may restrict their eating or overeat in response to their symptoms). Enquire about patients’ specific eating habits, address any issues that may be related or contributing to their anxiety, and provide advice about a healthy and balanced diet [Note 3].
Use a shared decision-making approach when discussing treatment options (psychosocial interventions, pharmacotherapy or both) with patients. Psychosocial interventions or pharmacotherapy may be appropriate as initial treatment options, depending on the patient and the specific anxiety disorder being treated—see Box 8.8 for types of anxiety disorders.
Managing patients with anxiety disorders may involve the concurrent use of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments. Historically there were concerns that combining benzodiazepines with psychosocial treatment may lead to poorer outcomes. It was thought that patients may attribute a reduction in anxiety to drug use rather than to exposure therapy, and experience a re-emergence of anxiety after stopping the drug. However, this association has now been challenged and there may be circumstances where patients use both treatment modalities simultaneously. Clinicians involved in the patient’s care should collaborate to ensure that psychosocial interventions and pharmacotherapy work synergistically to support the patient in managing their anxiety disorder.
Anxiety disorders are often relapsing or chronic conditions that require an adequate duration of therapy for the benefits to be evident. Symptoms may not completely resolve regardless of the type of therapy used.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:

Considerations in managing anxiety disorders during the perinatal period
It is important to identify and manage a person’s anxiety during pregnancy and after they give birth because:
There is insufficient evidence to guide a specific treatment approach for patients with anxiety disorders during the perinatal period; treatment is the same as for other patients. However, if psychotropic use is considered, discuss the potential harms and benefits of treatment with the patient and, if they consent, their significant other(s)—see Psychotropic use during pregnancy and Psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
Treating a patient with severe anxiety during the perinatal period can be complex—if possible, refer them to a specialist perinatal mental health service. Often a multidisciplinary team approach is required involving the usual treating clinician, a psychiatrist (preferably with perinatal expertise), the obstetric team and a paediatrician.
For further information and support for clinicians and patients, see the Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia (PANDA) website. The PANDA National Helpline (1300 726 306) provides risk assessment, support, counselling and information (including referral advice about local medical, mental health and family services) for new and expectant parents.
The Gidget Foundation Australia provides free telehealth counselling for parents in the perinatal period.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders in partners, see here.

Considerations in managing anxiety disorders in partners during the perinatal period
The limited data available about anxiety in partners during the perinatal period involves males but is likely to apply to all partners (regardless of their gender).
During the perinatal period, the partner commonly experiences anxiety and depression. The perinatal period is a time of huge adjustment with significant identity and psychosocial stress. Societal expectations of partners have changed over recent decades and their caregiving responsibilities have increased. Yet, partners often report feeling excluded from perinatal services and not entitled to receiving mental health care. The impact of perinatal anxiety in partners is relatively unknown but appears to impair their child’s emotional development.
There is insufficient evidence to recommend specific anxiety treatment or prevention strategies during the perinatal period for the partner. If an anxiety disorder is suspected in a partner in the perinatal period, assess and treat them as for the relevant disorder (see Assessing a person with anxiety). Limited evidence suggests that specific electronic education programs and partner-inclusive infant care classes can reduce anxiety in partners—see websites below.

Considerations in managing anxiety and associated disorders in children
Managing anxiety and associated disorders in children is similar to that for adults and young people; however:

Principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders
The role of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders is controversial. Benzodiazepines are rapid acting, well tolerated and effective anxiolytics for the most prominent symptoms of anxiety with a strong evidence base. However, benzodiazepines should not be used as first-line therapy for anxiety disorders because of potential harms (including increased risk of falls, memory problems, accidents, daytime sedation and dependence). Because of these harms, caution is needed in older patients and patients who have a history of problem substance use (particularly problem alcohol use). Also consider that there are few data on psychotropic use in young people because young people are poorly represented in clinical trials.
Benzodiazepine use is usually restricted to acute crises and the immediate short term. Maintenance therapy may be appropriate in patients who have not responded to other treatments and in those who are stable on a long-term regimen with good clinical response.
Benzodiazepines with short half-lives (ie less than 6 hours) are not recommended for anxiety disorders in these guidelines because they are the most addictive.
Box 8.9 outlines considerations for benzodiazepine use for an anxiety disorder in an adult or young person.
Consider the patient’s age, frailty and comorbidities [NB1] and the harm–benefit profile.
Assess the risk of misuse of benzodiazepines (either by the patient or other members of the household):
Discuss the potential for addiction with the patient.
When selecting a suitable dose, consider factors such as body size, age, comorbidities, drug history, previous response to sedative drugs and response to treatment. Older patients, particularly if frail, may require doses of drugs lower than the recommended range.
Prescribe small quantities at a time.
Provide advice about possible adverse effects, including the effects on a person’s ability to drive, operate heavy machinery or perform other tasks that require motor coordination and concentration.
Specify the expected duration of therapy and review the patient’s response regularly.
The role of benzodiazepines for anxiety disorders in children is different to that in adults and young people, because there is a limited evidence base. Because of the harms associated with benzodiazepines, their use should be restricted to specialists with experience in prescribing benzodiazepines to children. Short-term use of a benzodiazepine may be considered in the management of acute severe anxiety that significantly impairs functioning, in which the child is too anxious to engage in any other treatments.
Ideally seek specialist advice when deprescribing a long-term benzodiazepine used for an anxiety disorder—a gradual dose reduction over several months may be needed. Consider switching to a long-acting benzodiazepine (eg diazepam) before deprescribing.
Stopping a long-term benzodiazepine in a patient taking one for an anxiety disorder requires:

overview-bipolar-disorder,"Overview of bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder is characterised by distinct episodes of mania or hypomania, and depression—see Features of bipolar disorder.
The lifetime prevalence is approximately 0.6% for bipolar I disorder and 0.4% for bipolar II disorder. Bipolar disorder can reduce a person’s life expectancy by approximately 10 years (mainly due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, diabetes, and suicide), and affect their relationships, career and self-esteem. The risk of suicide is significant (up to 30 times greater than the general population), particularly during a depressive episode, or in patients with mixed features or rapid cycling bipolar disorder.
Bipolar disorder has a strong genetic basis and a peak onset in young people. Bipolar II disorder is more common in females, whereas the incidence of bipolar I disorder is the same in males and females.

Features of bipolar disorder
The mood episodes of bipolar disorder are mania, hypomania and depression.
Acute mania is a distinct period with an abrupt onset of symptoms, including abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood, accelerated speech, racing thoughts with flight of ideas, increased activity and reduced sleep requirements. Patients may develop grandiose ideas, act recklessly (including increased spending), and have increased sexual drive and activity. Patients who have psychosis are considered to have a severe presentation. To diagnose mania, symptoms must be present for most of the day, cause marked functional impairment and last for at least 1 week. However, a diagnosis of acute mania can be made with symptoms of any duration if the patient requires admission to hospital because of their symptoms.
A hypomanic episode is characterised by symptoms similar to those of a manic episode, but is differentiated from a manic episode by less severe symptoms that do not impair functioning. The symptoms last at least 4 consecutive days and are present for most of the day. People with hypomania do not experience psychotic symptoms.
Depressive episodes last for at least 2 weeks and must include a depressed mood, or a loss of interest or pleasure, for most of the day. The episode must cause significant distress or impair the person’s functioning; during depressive episodes, there is a high risk of suicide. While most symptoms overlap with those of major depression, patients with bipolar depression are more likely to have atypical depressive features (eg excessive sleeping or eating), psychomotor slowing, psychotic features or mixed features (ie manic or hypomanic features interspersed in the depression). Most patients experience at least one depressive episode before developing a first episode of mania or hypomania. Depressive episodes are the predominant mood episode for most patients with bipolar disorder, especially those with bipolar II disorder. Patients with bipolar disorder also frequently experience periods of subthreshold depressive symptoms between the major mood episodes.
Mixed features describes the simultaneous experience of symptoms opposite to the predominant state (eg during a manic episode, patients also experience depressive symptoms). Mixed features can occur during a manic, hypomanic or depressive episode.
Rapid cycling bipolar disorder can occur in some patients, in which at least 4 mood episodes are experienced in a 12-month period (ie manic, hypomanic or depressive episodes). This is the most difficult to treat of all bipolar disorder presentations.

Subtypes of bipolar disorder
The 2 predominant subtypes of bipolar disorder are bipolar I and bipolar II. There is debate about whether it is worthwhile to distinguish between bipolar I and bipolar II disorder but international consensus favours using the distinction.
Bipolar I disorder is characterised by at least one manic episode, usually accompanied by depressive episodes, that are not better explained by another disorder. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment.
Bipolar II disorder is characterised by hypomanic and depressive episodes that are not better explained by another disorder. The depressive episodes cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment.
Other subtypes of bipolar disorder (eg cyclothymic disorder, substance or drug-induced bipolar disorder) are not discussed in these guidelines.

Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in adults and young people
Diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires an accurate history about past mood episodes (see Features of bipolar disorder), including their number, frequency, intensity and duration. See here for characteristics of common bipolar disorder subtypes. Refer to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis.
Often a patient will initially present with a depressive episode; a diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made once an episode of mania or hypomania occurs. Hypomania can be particularly difficult to recognise because patients rarely seek treatment during a hypomanic episode. Ask all patients presenting with depressive symptoms about possible prior episodes of hypomania or mania, or a family history of bipolar disorder.
If a patient presents with manic or hypomanic symptoms, exclude other causes of their symptoms. If the patient has psychotic symptoms, also consider alternative causes of psychoses—see Box 8.39. Consider an underlying physical disorder (eg neurological, endocrine), particularly in patients older than 40 years because a first episode of mania is uncommon in this group; the peak onset of bipolar disorder is in young people.
Symptoms of bipolar disorder often overlap with other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, which can lead to misdiagnosis and consequently incorrect treatment. Approximately 50% of patients have concurrent alcohol or other substance problems, or an anxiety disorder. Correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder is often delayed by years, and consequently management may be suboptimal during this time.

Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in children
Bipolar disorder is extremely rare before puberty. Urgently refer children who display symptoms of bipolar disorder to a specialist centre (eg Headspace for children 12 years or older) or, if a specialist centre is not available, a psychiatrist or mental health team experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children is difficult, and requires expertise; the diagnosis is unstable and requires confirmation with prospective longitudinal monitoring.
Bipolar disorder is overdiagnosed in children with chronic irritability and disruptive behaviour—symptoms that are also characteristic of relational or attachment problems, and other psychiatric disorders. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a new diagnosis intended to describe many children with chronic irritability and disruptive behaviour, who would previously have inappropriately received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The creation of the diagnosis aims to reduce misdiagnosis and overtreatment, but it is not universally accepted.

Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people
Most people with bipolar disorder require psychiatrist management. The general practitioner’s role includes facilitating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, accessing specialist care and other services, and providing ongoing general medical care, monitoring and support to the patient. Shared care between the general practitioner and psychiatrist can improve health outcomes.
Other clinicians may be part of the multidisciplinary team depending on the patient’s needs, including a clinical psychologist, mental health nurse, occupational therapist and social worker. If available, an exercise physiologist and peer workers should be included in this team.
It is crucial for members of this team (particularly the primary clinician) to foster a therapeutic alliance with the patient to ensure continuity of care. Actively engage with the patient by listening attentively to their worries and concerns, and responding effectively and empathically.
Optimal management of bipolar disorder is multifaceted, and tailored to the type of mood episode (mania, hypomania or depression) and phase of the treatment (acute, maintenance or prophylactic therapy). Consider both the advice in this topic and the specific principles for:
Multifaceted management of bipolar disorder involves:
Drug therapy for bipolar disorder is complex. Sequential trials of pharmacotherapy may be required until the best balance of effectiveness and adverse effects is achieved.
See also the additional considerations in managing bipolar disorder:
Patient resources include:
When treating a young person with bipolar disorder, consider that:
If the patient is pregnant or in the postpartum, see also Considerations in managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy or Considerations in managing bipolar disorder in the postpartum.
Some drugs used for bipolar disorder (ie sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lithium) are associated, to varying degrees, with fetal malformations—educate a female of childbearing potential who has bipolar disorder about these risks and discuss options for contraception.
Some antipsychotics increase blood prolactin concentration and consequently reduce fertility; see Table 8.31 for the relative frequency of hyperprolactinaemia with individual antipsychotics. Inform a patient of childbearing potential taking an antipsychotic that causes hyperprolactinemia that their fertility may be impaired and that if the antipsychotic causing hyperprolactinemia is stopped, they may be at increased risk of becoming pregnant.
Inform a female of childbearing potential with bipolar disorder that relapse is common during the perinatal period and that ideally, they should plan a pregnancy with their general practitioner, psychiatrist and significant other to allow time to consider and trial treatment options—see Considerations in managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy and Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential.
For further information about psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential, including principles of use and advice on individual drugs, see here.
Managing a patient with bipolar disorder during pregnancy is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach including the patient’s general practitioner, psychiatrist (preferably with perinatal expertise), and obstetric team, and a paediatrician. If possible, refer the patient to a specialist perinatal mental health service.
If a patient with bipolar disorder becomes (or is planning to become) pregnant, formulate a management plan with their multidisciplinary team and, if they consent, their significant others—in addition to the factors listed here, consider and discuss:
Avoid stopping a psychotropic if doing so is likely to lead to relapse, psychiatric admission or exposure to multiple drugs in the setting of an acute behavioural disturbance. For a person with severe, unstable or currently symptomatic bipolar disorder, the priority is to optimise their mental state—the benefits of continuing a psychotropic (particularly lithium) throughout the perinatal period outweigh the risks of harm. This may involve continuing psychotropics or considering electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, if possible, avoid using sodium valproate because of the high risk of fetal malformation and neurodevelopmental disorders—see here.
Box 8.16 gives examples of managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy.
If a patient’s drug regimen is changed, review their mental state every 1 to 2 weeks for the next 4 to 8 weeks to monitor for signs of relapse. Seek psychiatrist advice for treatment and monitoring—the patient should see them within weeks of any change.
Regardless of the treatment decisions made, the most important aspect of managing bipolar disorder during the perinatal period is to closely monitor the patient’s mental state.
For advice on pharmacological treatment, see:
The advice can also be used in conjunction with the principles listed above to help guide a change of drug, if required.
A patient with a history of a few relatively mild episodes of bipolar II disorder who has been stable on lithium prophylaxis for the past 8 months discovers that they are 6 weeks pregnant. After discussing treatment options with their significant other, general practitioner and psychiatrist, they make an informed decision to stop lithium and continue without pharmacotherapy until immediately after birth, when they will start taking quetiapine (because they would like to breastfeed and lithium is not compatible with breastfeeding). The patient will have a high-resolution ultrasound and fetal echocardiography at 18 weeks to detect any congenital malformations (particularly cardiac). If they experience a relapse of bipolar depression during pregnancy, they will start taking quetiapine.
A patient taking olanzapine and sertraline for a current episode of bipolar depression discovers they are 10 weeks pregnant. This depressive episode occurred when they stopped taking sertraline. After discussing treatment options with their significant other, general practitioner and psychiatrist, they make an informed decision to continue sertraline and olanzapine throughout the perinatal period. The patient will have a high-resolution ultrasound and fetal echocardiography at 19 weeks to detect any congenital malformations.
A patient taking lithium and risperidone in combination with electroconvulsive therapy for severe recurrent episodes of acute mania with psychosis (the most recent was 3 months ago), discovers they are 12 weeks pregnant. After discussing treatment options with their significant other, general practitioner and psychiatrist, they make an informed decision to continue with the current treatment regimen. The patient will have a high-resolution ultrasound and fetal echocardiography at 20 weeks to detect any congenital malformations (particularly cardiac). Lithium will be withheld upon the onset of labour and restarted immediately after birth as per the recommendations here. Because the patient will be taking lithium during the postpartum, they will not breastfeed.
Managing a patient with bipolar disorder in the postpartum is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the patient’s general practitioner, psychiatrist and paediatrician. If possible, refer the patient to a specialist perinatal mental health service.
See also Considerations in managing bipolar disorder in females of childbearing potential.
The risk of relapse or postpartum psychosis in the postpartum period is at least 30%. Advise a patient with bipolar disorder who has chosen to avoid taking a psychotropic during their pregnancy to start a drug used for bipolar disorder prophylaxis immediately after delivery to reduce the risk of relapse or postpartum psychosis. Ideally, prophylaxis should be planned with the patient and their psychiatrist during the pregnancy and be overseen by their psychiatrist. Lithium has the most evidence of efficacy in this scenario, but its use may be limited by its contraindication in breastfeeding or if lithium was previously poorly tolerated or ineffective. If lithium is used, see Approach to perinatal lithium use for advice.
If a patient has remained on drug therapy during pregnancy, continue the same treatment in the postpartum; however, consider the breastfeeding safety profile of the drug and the effect of changing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after birth.

Principles of managing mixed features bipolar disorder in adults and young people
A manic or hypomanic episode with mixed features occurs when a patient having a manic episode simultaneously has some depressive symptoms. A depressive episode with mixed features occurs when a patient having a depressive episode simultaneously has some manic or hypomanic symptoms. If a patient meets the full diagnostic criteria for both a manic and depressive episode simultaneously, they are diagnosed with a manic episode with mixed features. For the symptoms of mood episodes, see Features of bipolar disorder.
Although the major mood disturbance determines the treatment approach, the presence of mixed features can affect drug choice. There is limited evidence to guide treatment choice and mixed features bipolar disorder is difficult to treat, so a psychiatrist should supervise management.
For patients presenting with a manic episode with mixed features, treatment follows the principles of treating acute mania. The following should inform drug choice (see Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people):
For patients presenting with a depressive episode with mixed features, determine whether the patient is taking any substances that may contribute to an elevated mood or induce cycling to another mood state (eg antidepressant monotherapy). If they are, gradually withdraw and stop the substance. The following should inform drug choice (see Overview of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people):
Although there are no controlled trials evaluating electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for mixed features bipolar disorder, psychiatrists may consider ECT for patients with severe symptoms.

Principles of managing rapid cycling bipolar disorder in adults and young people
Patients with 4 or more mood episodes in a 12-month period have rapid cycling bipolar disorder. It the most difficult to treat of all bipolar disorder presentations, so management should be supervised by a psychiatrist.
In some patients, rapid cycling bipolar disorder is precipitated by antidepressant use, hypothyroidism, problem substance use (eg alcohol, illicit drugs, excessive caffeine consumption) or nonprescription medicines, such as diet or weight-loss drugs. If a precipitant is identified, manage the condition or gradually withdraw the substance. Precipitous withdrawal of a substance can provoke a mood switch.
Treatment of rapid cycling bipolar disorder aims to stabilise the mood (ie prevent rapid cycling) with prophylactic therapy, rather than initiating or adjusting treatment of the current mood episode. No treatment has strong evidence in rapid cycling bipolar disorder but there is limited evidence for sodium valproate or carbamazepine monotherapy, so either drug may be trialled as initial treatment. If there has been no improvement after 3 to 4 months, trial the alternate drug. See Prophylaxis of bipolar disorder for drug regimens.
If symptoms are severe, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered.

Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children
Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children are similar to those for adults and young people (see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people). Also consider:

Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder in adults and young people
Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder help prevent relapse and restore quality of life—they range from psychoeducation to psychological therapies provided by experienced clinicians with appropriate training and resources (usually psychologists). Individualise interventions to the patient—considerations include the type of mood episode (mania, hypomania or depression) and phase of treatment (acute, maintenance or prophylactic therapy). Other interventions (eg case management) may also be required.
Start psychosocial interventions during the first mood episode or after recovery from the episode, and use throughout treatment.
Also assess whether the patient requires other psychosocial interventions including:
Psychoeducation is a key psychosocial intervention for bipolar disorder.
Psychological therapies with a role in managing bipolar disorder include:
Assertive community treatment describes the collaborative, community-based care of a person with a severe psychiatric disorder by a team of mental health professionals who provide a broad range of psychosocial interventions. These may include assistance with adherence to therapy, social skills training, welfare support, financial planning, health promotion, housing and counselling.
Cognitive remediation therapies (including social cognitive remediation therapy) address cognitive deficits by supporting patients to practise and improve their cognitive abilities. These treatments are provided in many formats (eg pen and paper, computer-assisted, web-based, face-to-face in individual or group settings). Although cognitive remediation therapies can significantly improve cognitive deficits, they must be integrated with other psychosocial interventions to improve daily function.
Social skills training aims to improve basic social functioning, and performance and interpersonal skills. It uses a variety of strategies (eg goal setting, increased structure or routine in the day, rehearsal of activities, role modelling, feedback, and positive reinforcement) to improve social interaction.
Supported employment and education (Individual Placement and Support [IPS]) involves a vocational specialist working with the person to source employment or education. The vocational specialist provides ongoing support to try to keep the person in employment or education. Supported employment is most effective if the vocational specialist is part of the person’s mental health team.

Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder help prevent relapse and restore quality of life—they range from psychoeducation to psychological therapies provided by experienced clinicians with appropriate training and resources (usually psychologists). Individualise interventions to the patient—considerations include the type of mood episode (mania, hypomania or depression) and phase of treatment (acute, maintenance or prophylactic therapy). Other interventions (eg case management) may also be required.
Start psychosocial interventions during the first mood episode or after recovery from the episode, and use throughout treatment.
Also assess whether the patient requires other psychosocial interventions including:

Psychoeducation is a key psychosocial intervention for bipolar disorder.

Psychological therapies with a role in managing bipolar disorder include:

Assertive community treatment describes the collaborative, community-based care of a person with a severe psychiatric disorder by a team of mental health professionals who provide a broad range of psychosocial interventions. These may include assistance with adherence to therapy, social skills training, welfare support, financial planning, health promotion, housing and counselling.

Cognitive remediation therapies (including social cognitive remediation therapy) address cognitive deficits by supporting patients to practise and improve their cognitive abilities. These treatments are provided in many formats (eg pen and paper, computer-assisted, web-based, face-to-face in individual or group settings). Although cognitive remediation therapies can significantly improve cognitive deficits, they must be integrated with other psychosocial interventions to improve daily function.

Social skills training aims to improve basic social functioning, and performance and interpersonal skills. It uses a variety of strategies (eg goal setting, increased structure or routine in the day, rehearsal of activities, role modelling, feedback, and positive reinforcement) to improve social interaction.

Supported employment and education (Individual Placement and Support [IPS]) involves a vocational specialist working with the person to source employment or education. The vocational specialist provides ongoing support to try to keep the person in employment or education. Supported employment is most effective if the vocational specialist is part of the person’s mental health team.

Identifying and treating comorbidities in people with bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To reduce rates of early morbidity and mortality, identify and manage chronic conditions.

Support for family members, carers or significant others of people with bipolar disorder
Families, carers or significant others of people with bipolar disorder need assistance and support from mental health services, carer support groups and health care professionals. Parents or carers of children or young people with bipolar disorder may require additional supports to manage the practical impacts of caring for them, and its impact on their own mental health. Carer assistance programs can provide support, education and respite care. Useful resources for family members, carers or significant others of a person with bipolar disorder include:
Involve family members, carers or significant others in psychoeducation to ensure they can recognise early symptoms of relapse and initiate early management of a mood episode."
overview-depressive-disorders,"Disorders that can cause depressive symptoms
Depressive symptoms are a feature of many disorders, including depressive disorders (eg major depression) and bipolar disorder.
Depressive symptoms cause varying degrees of functional impairment. The main depressive symptoms are low mood, or a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. Other depressive symptoms include:
Depressive disorders are differentiated by the frequency, intensity and duration of depressive episodes, and whether the onset is related to a specific event, medical condition or substance. Major depression is the classic disorder in the group of depressive disorders; however, there are a number of differential diagnoses that should be considered.
Major depression is diagnosed if a patient has at least 5 depressive symptoms for at least 2 weeks; and at least 1 of the symptoms is either depressed mood, or loss of interest or pleasure in activities. Depressive symptoms cause marked functional impairment.
If a patient with depressive symptoms does not meet the criteria for major depression, consider subthreshold depressive disorders, such as persistent depressive disorder (dysthymic disorder).
In major depression and subthreshold depressive disorders, depressive symptoms must not be better explained by another disorder (eg bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders) or triggered by a specific event, medical condition or substance.
Depressive symptoms can be triggered by specific events, medical conditions or substances including:
Exclude bipolar disorder as a cause of depressive symptoms. Often a patient with bipolar disorder will initially present with a depressive episode; a diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made once an episode of mania or hypomania occurs. Hypomania can be particularly difficult to recognise because patients rarely seek treatment during this time. Ask all patients presenting with depressive symptoms about possible prior episodes of hypomania or mania, or a family history of bipolar disorder; see Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.
Depressive symptoms in a person with personality disorder could be due to personality disorder or a co-occurring depressive disorder. Distinguish dysphoric affect of personality disorder—dysphoric symptoms that are relatively stable across situations and over a period of years (ie part of the individual’s ‘usual self’)—from distinct periods of a depressive episode; see Diagnosing personality disorder.

Assessing a person with depressive symptoms
Occasional depressive symptoms (eg low mood, sadness) are part of the general human condition. They are a normal response to life events or can occur for no apparent reason. If depressive symptoms are prolonged or excessive, they can become maladaptive and impair function, becoming clinically significant.
Assess a patient with depressive symptoms—see Box 8.28. The aim of assessing a patient with depressive symptoms is to:
There are multiple steps in assessing a patient with depressive symptoms.
Identify the cause:
Depressive symptoms can have various causes—see here. Consider diagnoses including:
Assess the patient’s safety:
Determine the presence of comorbidities:
Determine psychosocial contributors:
When assessing an older patient with depressive symptoms, also consider alternative explanations that become more common in older age, such as:
When assessing a child with depressive symptoms also consider that:
See the following topics for additional considerations in assessing depressive symptoms in:

Rating scales for depressive symptoms
Rating scales are a useful tool for screening, assessing and monitoring the success of treatment in patients with depressive symptoms. Screening using rating scales is not routine, but is essential during the postpartum period (see Perinatal depression). Do not rely solely on rating scales—use them in conjunction with clinical relationship-based care. Clinician-rated scales include the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Patient-rated scales include Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). These scales are available online and usually take less than 10 minutes to complete."
panic-attack,"Overview of panic attack
A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort. Symptoms of a panic attack may initially suggest an acute medical condition (eg heart attack, stroke, hyperthyroidism, a respiratory condition such as asthma) or a psychiatric disorder (eg social anxiety disorder, major depression, a psychotic disorder). Isolated panic attacks are common, occurring in around 15% of the population.
To diagnose a panic attack, 4 or more of the following symptoms need to have developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes:
Exclude conditions that may cause similar symptoms (eg asthma). Physical symptoms of pregnancy (eg tachycardia, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath) can mimic or precipitate a panic attack.
A panic attack can occur in the absence of a psychiatric disorder, or it can be a symptom of an anxiety disorder or other psychiatric disorder. For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see here.
A single panic attack is not the same as panic disorder, which is characterised by recurrent panic attacks that are not associated with a situational trigger (ie occur spontaneously).
Use psychosocial interventions to manage a panic attack. If the panic attack is a symptom of an anxiety disorder or other psychiatric disorder, treat the underlying condition accordingly. Short-term pharmacotherapy may be appropriate if psychosocial interventions are ineffective or not preferred.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as panic attack in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Psychosocial interventions for panic attack
Use psychosocial interventions initially in the treatment of a panic attack in adults, young people and children. Breathing techniques (ie breathing slowly and deeply) can be used immediately to raise arterial carbon dioxide concentration; this abolishes many acute symptoms.
As soon as possible after a panic attack, provide psychoeducation to the patient and, if relevant, their family, carers or significant others. Providing an explanation of a panic attack, support and stress management advice can be effective.

Pharmacotherapy for panic attack in adults and young people
If psychosocial interventions are not effective or preferred, short-term pharmacotherapy with a benzodiazepine may be appropriate. However, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence. These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use; in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits (see Principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders).
If a benzodiazepine is considered appropriate for panic attack in an adult or young person, use:
If a panic attack worsens or does not resolve despite using psychosocial and pharmacological treatment, manage as for an acute behavioural disturbance. See Approach to managing acute behavioural disturbance.

Pharmacotherapy for panic attack in children
Psychosocial interventions are first-line treatment for panic attack. If symptoms of a panic attack do not resolve with psychosocial intervention or rapid resolution of symptoms is needed in a crisis, pharmacotherapy may be used. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use this concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.
Benzodiazepine use in children is not supported by controlled trials. Furthermore, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, daytime sedation and dependence, and may cause paradoxical disinhibition in children. Nevertheless, a single dose of a benzodiazepine may be used if rapid resolution of symptoms is needed in a crisis, or to help alleviate acute panic symptoms and allow the child to engage in psychosocial treatment (eg exposure therapy in school refusal). Follow the principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders.
If a benzodiazepine is indicated for panic attack, a suitable regimen in children 6 years or older is:
In the rare circumstance that pharmacotherapy is required in a child younger than 6 years, seek specialist advice on dosing."
panic-disorder,"Overview of panic disorder
Panic disorder affects 2 to 3% of the population and is 3 times more common in females than males. It is characterised by recurrent panic attacks, in which the onset of the attack is not associated with a trigger (ie occur spontaneously), and not caused by a substance, drug, medical condition or another psychiatric disorder (eg depression, bipolar disorder).
Associated symptoms of panic disorder include:
The presentation in children is similar to that in adults and young people.
For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.
Use psychosocial interventions as first-line treatment for panic disorder. If psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, consider pharmacotherapy—see here for adults and young people, and here for children. Pharmacotherapy is usually only used for children with severe symptoms.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
Physical symptoms of pregnancy (eg tachycardia, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath) can mimic or precipitate a panic attack. Pregnant females are more likely to experience panic disorder than those who are not pregnant; onset tends to be in the first and second trimesters. Individuals with panic disorder may avoid antenatal appointments because they fear having panic attacks during travel to or attendance at appointments. Poorer antenatal care attendance increases the risk of poor obstetric outcomes. For additional considerations in managing anxiety disorders in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Psychosocial interventions for panic disorder
Use psychosocial interventions as first-line treatment for panic disorder.
Provide psychoeducation about the disorder; in particular, explain how the panic attack produces physical symptoms. Advise the patient to use the breathing control techniques described for the treatment of acute panic attack and relaxation strategies.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for panic disorder—CBT can be used to challenge misattributions about the physiological symptoms of panic and to establish strategies to manage them. Several types of CBT can be used for panic disorder. The most commonly used is panic control treatment, which involves exposure to deliberately induce symptoms together with techniques (eg controlled slow breathing) for controlling them, and reattribution of symptoms to benign causes (eg palpitations are not due to cardiac arrest).
There is limited evidence for acceptance and commitment therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy.

Maintenance pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in adults and young people
For the acute management of a panic attack, see here.
Treat panic disorder with psychosocial interventions. If psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, consider pharmacotherapy.
If an antidepressant is indicated for maintenance treatment of panic disorder, initial choice should be informed by:
SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) are first-line drugs for panic disorder. Compared to other indications, lower initial doses are used because patients with panic disorder can be extremely sensitive to the activating effects of SSRIs.
The serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine) have less evidence than SSRIs in panic disorder, but are an option in patients who have a poor response to, or cannot tolerate, SSRIs.
If an SSRI or SNRI is considered appropriate for panic disorder, individualise the choice of drug (see above). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Use:

Maintenance pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in children
Psychosocial interventions are first-line treatment for panic disorder in children. If psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, pharmacotherapy may be considered, but is usually reserved for children with severe symptoms. If possible, pharmacotherapy should be combined with psychosocial interventions. Many children with panic disorder respond well to a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]). If pharmacotherapy is used, it is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are preferred; however, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events. A benzodiazepine may be considered to manage an acute panic attack—see here.
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for panic disorder, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children, whereas the maximum doses approximate those used in adults and young people. In children 12 years and older, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for panic disorder, use:

Follow-up and duration of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to antidepressant treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.5). Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 to 2 weeks; full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].

Nonresponse to maintenance pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in adults and young people
Consider modifying treatment for panic disorder in an adult or young person if symptoms persist despite:
Options for treatment modification include:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as panic disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners see here.
Studies have shown that clonazepam is an effective treatment for panic disorder and may be associated with lower rates of long-term relapse compared to SSRIs. However, benzodiazepines should not be used as first-line pharmacotherapy because of potential harms (including increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence). These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use (particularly problem alcohol use); in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits.
Benzodiazepine use is usually restricted to acute crises (see Panic attack) and short-term initial therapy. In treatment resistance, they may be considered for maintenance therapy, ideally in consultation with a psychiatrist. Follow the principles for the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders.
If a benzodiazepine is considered appropriate for panic disorder, a suitable regimen in adults and young people is:
Psychiatrists may use a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) (clomipramine, imipramine) for panic disorder. A TCA can be considered first line if the patient has responded well to them previously. Doses of TCAs for treating panic disorder are often higher than the doses for treating depression; however, the dose must be increased gradually to reduce initial adverse effects. Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Intolerance commonly limits the use of TCAs, and toxicity in overdose must be considered. TCAs can cause changes in cardiac conduction—an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained before treatment is started and repeated once the dose is stabilised, usually after 6 weeks. If either ECG shows abnormalities, seek advice from a cardiologist before starting or continuing treatment.
If a TCA is considered appropriate for panic disorder, a suitable regimen in adults and young people is:
Psychiatrists may use phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor [MAOI]) in treatment resistance; however, dietary restrictions hinder its use (see Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]).

Nonresponse to maintenance pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in children
Refer children with panic disorder to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input, if their symptoms persist despite:"
parasomnias,"Introduction to parasomnias
Parasomnias are undesirable behaviours or experiences that occur while falling asleep, sleeping or waking.
Parasomnias are classified into 3 broad groups according to the stage of sleep in which they occur:

Non-REM parasomnias
Sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleepwalking are disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. During these parasomnias, which typically occur during the first half of sleep, a person appears to be awake and asleep at the same time. Upon waking, the event is usually not remembered.
A sleep terror (night terror) is characterised by an intense feeling of fear often accompanied by screaming and crying, violent thrashing movements and autonomic activation (eg sweating and tachycardia). The person may not wake during the sleep terror but, if they do, can be disorientated.
A confusional arousal is characterised by confusion upon arousal from sleep. The person may sit up in bed, look around and speak, but appear confused and unaware of their surroundings. These episodes are short; the person usually returns to sleep.
Sleepwalking occurs when a person who is asleep walks and potentially engages in an activity (eg talking, driving, cooking, moving furniture).
Non-REM parasomnias are common and most frequently occur in children. Stress, sleep deprivation, drugs (especially alcohol, zolpidem, lithium), physical illness and other sleep disorders (eg sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements) can be precipitants. If a non-REM parasomnia first presents in adulthood, it is likely to be caused by an adverse drug effect, stress or a neurological disorder (eg sleep-related epilepsy).
Manage a non-REM parasomnia by educating the person and their significant other(s) about the condition. Patient information on sleep terrors and sleep walking is available on the Sleep Health Foundation website. The Royal Children’s Hospital provides advice for parents with children who have sleep terrors (see here) or sleepwalk (see here).
As people do not usually recall non-REM parasomnias, distress may be minimised by not waking them during an episode. If a drug is suspected to be causing the parasomnia, reduce the dose or stop the drug if possible. If lack of sleep is a likely precipitant, see here for advice for adults and the Raising Children website for advice for children and adolescents.
If sleepwalking is frequent or dangerous to the patient or others, make the sleeping environment safe. As relevant, recommend:
Refer the patient to a sleep specialist, and in the case of children, a paediatrician, if:
Pharmacotherapy is rarely required for non-REM parasomnias. However, sleep specialists will sometimes use a benzodiazepine if sleepwalking or sleep terrors are significantly affecting the patient’s quality of life or placing them or those around them in danger, and other interventions are ineffective.

REM Parasomnias
A nightmare is a disturbing dream that usually occurs late in sleep, during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase. Upon wakening, the person will quickly orientate and vividly remember the nightmare, which can cause distress. Nightmares are common (particularly in children) and most often, are a normal part of life, not requiring treatment. However, if nightmares are recurrent and cause significant distress or functional impairment, further investigation is required.
Recurrent nightmares featuring a repeated story are commonly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—see here for PTSD diagnosis and management, including management of nightmares.
Some drugs (eg beta blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists) can cause vivid dreams or nightmares. If a drug is suspected to be the cause of ongoing nightmares, consider adjusting the time of administration, reducing the dose or stopping the drug—often nightmares will then resolve. Conversely, withdrawing or stopping drugs that suppress REM sleep (eg alcohol, antidepressants, some hypnotics) can precipitate nightmares.
If recurrent nightmares appear to have no clear cause, consider psychological therapies (eg imagery rehearsal therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy). If these therapies are not effective or unavailable, seek specialist advice for further treatment options.
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by complex motor activity and vocal dream enactment behaviour associated with loss of normal REM muscle tone (atonia). This parasomnia can result in violent and dangerous behaviour during sleep. REM sleep behaviour disorder is predominantly seen in older people and affects more males than females (ratio 9:1). In most patients, REM sleep behaviour disorder precedes or is associated with alpha synucleinopathies (eg Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple systems atrophy). REM sleep behaviour disorder is occasionally associated with other neurological disorders (eg narcolepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders) or drugs (eg alcohol, antidepressants, beta blockers).
If REM sleep behaviour disorder is suspected, refer the patient to a sleep specialist or neurologist for evaluation and treatment. Differential diagnoses include nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, posttraumatic stress disorder and other parasomnias.
Counsel the patient about ways to make their sleep environment safer (eg remove furniture or objects near the bed that could cause injury; move the bed away from windows; avoid sleeping with other people). If REM sleep behaviour disorder is violent or poses a risk of injury, specialists sometimes use melatonin or clonazepam.

people-at-risk-psychosis,"Identifying people at risk of psychosis
One-third of people identified as being at risk of psychosis (prodromal stage of psychosis) experience a full psychotic episode within 3 years; most episodes occur within the first year. Identify people at risk of developing psychosis to:
A person is considered at risk of psychosis if they have recently experienced significant functional decline or have longstanding poor function and have any of the following features:
People at risk of psychosis are typically aged between 14 and 35 years and often have other psychiatric comorbidities (eg depression, anxiety, substance use); these should be treated.

Managing people at risk of psychosis
Refer people at risk of psychosis for urgent management by a specialist centre (eg Headspace for people aged 12 to 25 years) or, if a specialist centre is unavailable, a psychiatrist. Ideally, the person’s family, carers or significant others should be involved in their treatment. Psychosocial interventions, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), are the treatments of choice for people at risk of psychosis. Combined with close monitoring, these interventions appear to be most effective at stopping a full episode of psychosis from developing.
Do not start an antipsychotic for a person at risk of psychosis unless they:"
perinatal-depression,"Antenatal depression
Approximately 10% of pregnant individuals experience depression. In Australia, suicide is a leading cause of death during the perinatal period, exceeding causes of death directly related to childbirth or its complications. Although reducing psychotropic effects on the fetus is important, it is equally important not to undertreat depression during pregnancy because of increased risk of suicide and other adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
During pregnancy, people with depression are more likely to report pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and dizziness, and often have comorbid anxiety; see Assessing a person with anxiety and Considerations in managing anxiety disorders during the perinatal period. They generally have lower attendance at antenatal appointments; poorer nutrition; higher rates of smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use; and are less likely to take vitamin and mineral supplements. Antenatal depression is the most important risk factor for postnatal depression—see also Preventing postnatal depression.
Antenatal depression is associated with miscarriage, preterm birth, increased neonatal cortisol concentration at birth, low neonatal birthweight, smaller neonatal head circumference and poor neonatal adaptation. These associations make it difficult to determine if obstetric and neonatal complications are attributable to depression during pregnancy or the drugs used to treat it.
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10 item, self-reported questionnaire used to screen for depression at least once during pregnancy and may also assist assessment of depressive symptoms during this time. An EPDS score of 13 or higher indicates possible depression requiring further assessment. The EPDS may also help monitor response to therapy—a change in score of 4 points or higher is considered meaningful postpartum (but may be applicable antenatally).
The Antenatal Risk Questionnaire (ANRQ) screens for psychosocial risk factors for depression (eg a past history of mental health problems or trauma, current or past intimate partner violence) and can be a useful adjunct to the EPDS.
The principles of treating major depression during pregnancy are similar to those for the general population—see here. It is especially important to optimise psychosocial support during the perinatal period and adjust treatment with the following considerations.
If a patient with pre-existing depression becomes pregnant, emphasise the importance of effectively treating their depression and review the treatment plan—discuss pharmacological and psychological therapies; see Principles of treating major depression and Psychotropic use during pregnancy. Patients with pre-existing depression who become pregnant often stop pharmacological therapy because of perceived risk to the fetus. If the patient has a history of multiple or severe depressive episodes, avoid stopping effective therapy because of the high risk of relapse; patients with a history of severe or treatment-resistant depression will require a psychiatric opinion to guide management. If pre-existing depression worsens during pregnancy, see advice below.
If mild or moderate depression develops during pregnancy, use psychological therapies as first-line treatment (eg cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy). Given the relatively short timeframe of pregnancy and the potential lag time for response to psychological therapies, also consider starting an antidepressant for moderate depression. Use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) other than paroxetine (sertraline is most commonly used)—see Antidepressant use during pregnancy and Approach to antidepressant therapy for major depression in adults and young people. If the patient intends to breastfeed, avoid starting fluoxetine during pregnancy because it has the highest reported concentrations, of all SSRIs, in breastmilk.
If new-onset severe depression develops during pregnancy, start a SSRI other than paroxetine (sertraline is most commonly used)—see Antidepressant use during pregnancy and Initial pharmacological treatment of major depression in adults. If the patient intends to breastfeed, avoid starting fluoxetine during pregnancy. If the patient is willing and able, also offer psychological therapies.
Treating (new or pre-existing) severe depression during pregnancy can be complex—if possible, refer to a specialist perinatal mental health service. Often a multidisciplinary team approach is required involving the usual treating clinician, a psychiatrist (preferably with perinatal expertise), the obstetric team and a paediatrician; electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered. Ideally, a patient with severe depression should give birth in a tertiary hospital with specialist neonatal care and a psychiatric team. If this is not possible, seek advice from the patient’s psychiatrist and a paediatrician.
For further information and support for clinicians and patients, see the Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia (PANDA) website. The PANDA National Helpline (1300 726 306) provides risk assessment, support, counselling and information (including referral advice about local medical, mental health and family services).

If the patient intends to breastfeed, avoid starting fluoxetine during pregnancy. If the patient is willing and able, also offer psychological therapies.
Treating (new or pre-existing) severe depression during pregnancy can be complex—if possible, refer to a specialist perinatal mental health service. Often a multidisciplinary team approach is required involving the usual treating clinician, a psychiatrist (preferably with perinatal expertise), the obstetric team and a paediatrician; electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered. Ideally, a patient with severe depression should give birth in a tertiary hospital with specialist neonatal care and a psychiatric team. If this is not possible, seek advice from the patient’s psychiatrist and a paediatrician.

Postnatal depression
Maternal postnatal depression is common and is associated with significant harm including infanticide and suicide; see Assessing postnatal depression for further detail. However, evidence for interventions to prevent postnatal depression is limited.
The Antenatal Risk Questionnaire (ANRQ), helps to identify pregnant patients at high risk of postnatal depression who may particularly benefit from psychosocial interventions and close monitoring in the postnatal period.
Psychosocial interventions (eg groups and home visiting) during the perinatal period, and the identification and treatment of antenatal depression can reduce the risk of postnatal depression. Maximising support and general health and wellbeing (including optimising sleep) are likely to help to prevent postnatal depression and are unlikely to cause harm. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation does not prevent postnatal depression, despite promising data from early small studies.
Limited preliminary evidence suggests antidepressant use during the perinatal period can prevent postnatal depression. However, the evidence is not sufficiently robust to endorse this practice. Nevertheless, a patient with a history of severe postnatal depression can consider restarting a previously effective antidepressant late in the third trimester or immediately after giving birth—see also Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding and Antidepressant use while breastfeeding.
After giving birth, up to 15% of people experience depression. Postnatal depression is typically diagnosed within 6 weeks postpartum; however, the principles in this section apply throughout the first postnatal year.
In addition to the features of major depression, common symptoms include difficulties coping with the infant, guilty thoughts about being a bad parent, excessive anxiety about infant wellbeing and irritability towards family. Comorbid anxiety (eg generalised anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]) is highly prevalent; identify and diagnose anxiety disorders to guide treatment; see Assessing a person with anxiety and Considerations in managing anxiety disorders during the perinatal period.
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item, self-reported questionnaire used to screen for depression at least once during the postnatal period (usually at 6 weeks) and may also assist assessment of depressive symptoms during this time. An EPDS score of 13 or higher indicates possible depression requiring further assessment. The EPDS can also help to monitor response to therapy—a change in score of 4 points or greater is considered meaningful.
The potential for harm through suicide or infanticide, or neglect or physical abuse to infants or other children is a major concern in postpartum depression. In Australia, suicide is a leading cause of death during the perinatal period, exceeding causes directly related to childbirth or its complications. Not all patients who experience suicidal thoughts have infanticidal thoughts. Some may erroneously believe that their symptoms cannot represent postnatal depression because they still have loving feelings for their infant. Take a tactful and sensitive approach in exploring symptomatology and determining whether the patient has:
If the risk of harm to the patient or infant is high or cannot be determined, or postpartum psychosis is suspected, consider an urgent psychiatric assessment (eg by a community mental health team, in an emergency department).
In addition to the risks of suicide and infanticide, postnatal depression may impair the parent–infant relationship; there is some evidence that this may lead to poorer cognitive and behavioural outcomes in the child.
For further information and support for clinicians and patients, see the Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia (PANDA) website. The PANDA National Helpline (1300 726 306) provides risk assessment, support, counselling and information (including referral advice about local medical, mental health and family services).
The principles of treating postnatal depression are similar to those for treating major depression in the general population—see here. It is especially important to optimise psychosocial support during the postnatal period and adjust treatment with the following considerations.
Postnatal depression can affect the parent–infant relationship and this relationship may not fully recover without specific treatment. Options include seeing a parent–infant therapist or accessing a locally-available group or individual therapy program. Information on local services is available from the Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia (PANDA) National Helpline (1300 726 306), and may be available from the local maternity hospital, particularly the perinatal mental health team.
If a patient has stable pre-existing depression, a change of treatment approach in the postnatal period is not required. If the patient is breastfeeding and takes a psychotropic, see Psychotropic use while breastfeeding. If pre-existing depression worsens, see advice below.
If a patient develops new-onset mild or moderate postnatal depression, treat with psychological therapies as first-line treatment—cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy and group therapy have evidence in this population.
If a patient develops new-onset severe postnatal depression, start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (sertraline is most commonly used). Fluoxetine is avoided in breastfeeding because it has the highest reported concentrations, of all SSRIs, in breastmilk—see Antidepressant use while breastfeeding and Approach to antidepressant therapy for major depression in adults and young people. If the patient is willing and able, also start psychological treatment.
Treating a patient with (new-onset or existing) severe postnatal depression can be complex—if possible, refer to a specialist perinatal mental health service. Often a multidisciplinary team approach is required involving the usual treating clinician, a psychiatrist (preferably with perinatal expertise), and a paediatrician. In some cases, hospitalisation is required, ideally in a parent–infant unit where both parent and infant are co-admitted [Note 1].

Depression in partners in the perinatal period
The limited data available about depression in partners during the perinatal period involves males, but is likely to apply to all partners (regardless of their gender).
More than 1 in 10 male partners experience perinatal depression. Depression risk is higher in those who have:
Perinatal depression in partners affects the behavioural, emotional and cognitive development of children. Perinatal depression in partners may be prevented by including them in perinatal care:
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a 10-item questionnaire used to screen for maternal perinatal depression, can facilitate assessment of paternal perinatal depression. An EPDS score of 10 or higher can indicate depression—see Assessing a person with depressive symptoms.
If perinatal depression in a partner is identified, treat as for an episode of depression outside the perinatal period—there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific treatment approach.

personality-disorder,"Diagnosing personality disorder
Personality is a person’s unique combination of general tendencies or traits, desires, beliefs, concerns, coping mechanisms, and life story (narrative). Personality is considered normal when it allows a person to adapt to their circumstances and environment, but what is considered normal can depend on cultural norms (eg high emotional expression is expected in some societies but not others). Personality disorder occurs when features of a person’s personality are inflexible or maladaptive, and interfere with the person’s ability to adapt to or manage changes in their circumstances or environment. Personality disorder involves both:
The aetiology of personality disorder is complex, involving an interplay between factors that predispose a person to a vulnerable temperament (eg familial risk, prenatal exposures), deficits in the caregiving environment in infancy, and ongoing maladaptive social experiences [Note 1]. This results in the deficits in emotional regulation and social communication seen in a person with personality disorder. Although adverse life experiences in childhood (eg trauma, abuse, neglect) are associated with personality disorder, and should be considered when personality disorder is suspected, adverse experiences are nonspecific to personality disorder. In addition, some patients with personality disorder report no adversity in childhood.
Personality disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, the prevalence in clinical settings is higher because people with personality disorder seek treatment more frequently—personality disorder is prevalent in a quarter of patients attending primary care and up to half of patients attending specialist psychiatric services.
Personality disorder usually becomes apparent during the transition from childhood to adulthood, when the capacity for self-reflection and a life narrative is developed. Disturbances in cognition, emotions, behaviour and relationships must be:
Timely diagnosis of personality disorder is key, because untreated personality disorder can disrupt the complex developmental tasks required to achieve adult role functioning and cause severe, long-term adverse outcomes, including severe functional disability, physical illness, self-harm and suicide. Suspect personality disorder in a person who has persistent interpersonal difficulties (eg difficulties with empathy, intimacy, understanding others’ perspectives, managing conflict) or difficulties in self-management (eg identity disturbance, self-reflection, self-worth). To establish the impact and persistence of the maladaptive behaviours, consult at least one other source of information, including
Patients with personality disorder usually present during times of acute crisis, following self-harm, or due to poor physical health. They are particularly vulnerable to self-harm and suicidal behaviour, due to their sometimes impulsive and self-damaging behaviour. For information on how to recognise patients at risk of suicide, see here.
The high rate of co-occurring psychiatric disorders (eg anxiety disorders, major depression, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug problems) may cause diagnostic confusion. This can lead to missed, delayed or incorrect diagnosis, unnecessary investigation and use of pharmacotherapy that may be ineffective or harmful. There is a strong association between personality disorder and alcohol and drug problems—studies report a lifetime prevalence of such problems of over 50% in people with personality disorder. Alcohol and other drug problems contribute to premature mortality in people with personality disorder, so it is important that they are detected, assessed and treated.
When a diagnosis of personality disorder is made, it should be classified according to the severity and any trait domains or patterns, which describe the prominent characteristics of the person’s personality.
The way in which personality disorder is classified is transitioning from a categorical system to a system that describes personality disorder on a spectrum of severity.
The categorical classification distinguishes different types of personality disorders according to the dominant features that are characteristic of the person’s personality (eg paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive). However, this approach is problematic because the categories are overlapping, lack validity, and no clear threshold exists between types and degrees of personality disorders.
In contemporary practice, personality disorder is classified according to its severity, which may be accompanied by a specifier that describes the prominent personality traits or patterns characteristic of the person. This approach is reflected in both the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
The severity (mild, moderate or severe) is related to the breadth of maladaptive behaviour and the degree to which it impairs the person’s life, such as:
For example:
The prominent personality traits that may be specified with the severity classification include:
Multiple personality traits can be used in an individual, and it is usually necessary to do so for people with more severe personality disorder.
In addition to determining the severity and prominent personality traits, assess whether a borderline pattern may be specified. A borderline pattern is specified if the person has a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects, and marked impulsivity; this is considered the most severe specifier and is synonymous with borderline personality disorder in the categorical classification system.

Principles of managing personality disorder
Because personality disorder is common, all clinicians are likely to encounter patients with personality disorder, and will need to employ specific skills to effectively treat them. Severe personality disorder usually requires a collaborative multidisciplinary approach. By following the key principles of working with patients with personality disorder, all clinicians can contribute positively to their care.
The therapeutic relationship between the patient and clinician is central to personality disorder management and can provide an environment that allows change. However, it can be challenging because, by definition, people with personality disorder have difficulties with interpersonal relationships (see The clinician–patient relationship in patients with a personality disorder).
When making a diagnosis of personality disorder, the clinician should openly and honestly discuss the diagnosis with the patient (see Psychoeducation for personality disorder). Clinicians also play an important role in addressing the stigma associated with personality disorder.
People with personality disorder often present during an acute crisis. Patients usually respond well to being given support and time to talk about their concerns—follow the key principles for working with a patient with personality disorder. Use simple problem-solving strategies to address immediate precipitants and involve the patient’s family, carers or significant others if possible. If these strategies are insufficient to manage the acute crisis, consider using adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Although clinicians may feel pressured by the patient to use pharmacotherapy, or compelled by a sense that alternatives are lacking, pharmacotherapy is not first line. Follow the patient’s management plan, if they have one.
If a patient with personality disorder is acutely agitated or has an acute behavioural disturbance, do not start treatment before determining that it is safe and appropriate to intervene. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated or at risk of harming themselves or others, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for advice on drug therapy.
Even if management is first initiated for an acute crisis, simultaneously plan long-term management (see Management plan for a person with personality disorder). Psychosocial interventions are the mainstay of long-term management and can include individual, group and family approaches, as well as social support and environmental modification. For many people with personality disorder, effective psychosocial interventions can be instigated in primary care, without the need for further referral. However, patients with moderate to severe personality disorder or those who do not respond to treatment should be referred to a specialist mental health service or personality disorder service [Note 2]. Pharmacological treatment has limited or no role in the management of personality disorder itself.
Treatment of personality disorder usually occurs in an outpatient setting to allow the patient to improve their management of day-to-day stressors and interpersonal relationships. Inpatient treatment is rarely indicated, but may be required to manage an acute crisis if other approaches (eg intensive outpatient treatment) have been unsuccessful—admissions are usually brief and should have specific goals. Inpatient treatment may also be required to treat co-occurring conditions (eg major depression, psychoses).
For considerations in managing personality disorder in females of childbearing potential, see here and the perinatal period, see here.

Psychoeducation for personality disorder
To avoid stigma around personality disorder, clinicians diagnosing the disorder need to provide psychoeducation to the patient, and their family, carers or significant others: openly and honestly discuss the diagnosis, the likely course of the disorder, treatment options and common misconceptions. Allow adequate time for the discussion.
Encourage the patient to ask questions and to make note of any questions that occur to them after the discussion. Be sensitive when responding to the patient’s questions, because they may already attach stigma to the diagnosis.
Project Air has patient information on personality disorder.
For general information on psychoeducation, see here.

Management plan for a patient with personality disorder
Collaborate with a patient with personality disorder, as well as their family, carers or significant others, to develop a tailored management plan. The management plan should include:
Review the management plan regularly.
Find templates and further advice for developing a management plan at Project Air, Spectrum or another personality disorder organisation.

The clinician–patient relationship in personality disorder management
The therapeutic relationship between the clinician and patient plays an important role in personality disorder management, and provides an environment that can facilitate change. It is often helpful for clinicians to remember that, when treating a person with personality disorder, they are usually seeing them at their lowest ebb, when problems are likely to be at their most severe.
Since personality disorder involves difficulties with empathy, intimacy, understanding others’ perspectives, managing conflict and self-reflection, the therapeutic relationship can become strained at times. The clinician should seek to understand how the person prefers to interact. In expressing their needs, the person may ask the clinician to say or do things that the clinician experiences as unrealistic or demanding. When the clinician is unable to meet these needs the patient may respond with, for example, aggression or extreme emotionality. Clinicians can often feel provoked by such encounters and reciprocate in ways that are often uncharacteristic. A flexible and self-reflective response style, acknowledging the patient’s needs while also letting the patient know the limits of what the clinician can provide, can help to maintain engagement. Clinicians should not be afraid to respectfully discuss their own limits with the patient or to seek advice from their peers.
Strategies to foster an effective therapeutic relationship include collaborative goal setting, being clear about mutual expectations and acceptable behaviour, encouraging the patient to develop self-control, and helping the patient to associate feelings with events and actions. Use a structured approach to personality disorder problems following the key principles in Box 8.37. Discuss the case with other clinicians.

Addressing the stigma associated with personality disorder
The terms used to describe personality disorder are sometimes used inappropriately, or in a pejorative manner. This may serve to stigmatise personality disorder and lead to inadequate assessment and treatment, or even denial of service. Personality disorder is a treatable condition—the behaviours that people with personality disorder display (eg being ‘difficult’ or antisocial, severe emotional or interpersonal dysregulation) should not be a reason to exclude them from a health service or deny treatment.
This stigma is most often perpetuated by health professionals and it is the responsibility of all clinicians to be proactive and educate their peers when this occurs. To address the stigma that currently surrounds a diagnosis of personality disorder, have an open and honest discussion with the patient at the time of diagnosis (see Psychoeducation for personality disorder) and record the diagnosis in the patient’s medical history.

Considerations in managing personality disorder in females of childbearing potential
Personality disorder can affect a female of childbearing potential’s sexual health and behaviour (including contraception use), relationships and pregnancies. Females who have severe personality disorder with a borderline pattern are at increased risk of early and unprotected sexual intercourse, and early and unplanned pregnancies.
Discuss contraception and preconception planning with patients—see here for advice. If preconception planning is possible, explicitly and supportively discuss the additional emotional and relationship challenges associated with pregnancy and parenting—highlight the importance of support throughout the perinatal period.

Considerations in managing personality disorder in the perinatal period
There is limited evidence about perinatal outcomes in females with personality disorder. While many people with personality disorder successfully navigate pregnancy and the perinatal period, data show that females who have severe personality disorder with a borderline pattern are more likely to:
The principles of managing personality disorder in the perinatal period are similar to the principles described here, with the following additional requirements:

Psychosocial interventions for personality disorder
The core treatment of personality disorder is psychosocial intervention. Many types of psychosocial interventions have randomised controlled trial evidence of efficacy for personality disorder [Note 4]. The most commonly studied are dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) and mentalisation-based therapy (MBT); no specific intervention has been shown to be more effective than others. Moreover, specific types of individual psychotherapy are not more effective than high-quality structured clinical care, based on a model of personality disorder. This is also known as ‘good psychiatric management’ or ‘good clinical care’ and follows the key principles of working with a person with personality disorder; this psychosocial intervention is well suited to nonspecialists. Therefore, the choice of psychosocial intervention for personality disorder is guided by:
Common characteristics of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for personality disorder include:
The patient’s motivation and engagement in treatment, and the clinician’s confidence and competence in managing personality disorder, will determine the outcome and duration of treatment. If possible, psychotherapy should occur weekly over the planned course of treatment.
Successful treatment usually requires the patient’s active participation. However, some individuals with severe personality disorder or certain personality traits (eg prominent dissociality in which the impact of the disorder is felt more by other people) lack sufficient motivation or incentive to change. In this circumstance, modification of the person’s environment is a treatment option. Environmental modification involves assisting other people to manage the person with personality disorder in the community and respond to them in a more adaptive and less harmful way.

Pharmacological treatment of personality disorder
Pharmacotherapy has a limited role in the primary treatment personality disorder; psychosocial interventions are the core treatment. However, pharmacotherapy may be considered to target specific symptoms when these are severe, cause significant functional impairment or distress, or have not been adequately addressed with psychosocial interventions—there is an absence of high-quality evidence of efficacy. Consider that patients often seek treatment when they are at their lowest ebb. Although clinicians may feel pressured by the patient to use pharmacotherapy, or compelled by a sense that alternatives are lacking, pharmacotherapy is not first line.
Symptoms of personality disorder that pharmacotherapy may be used to target are:
Before considering pharmacotherapy to target symptom(s) of personality disorder, consider if the symptom(s) could be caused by a co-occurring psychiatric disorder; for example:
If a co-occurring psychiatric disorder is diagnosed, its management may include pharmacotherapy. If the target symptom(s) are not better explained by a co-occurring psychiatric disorder, use psychosocial interventions first line and only consider adjunctive pharmacotherapy.
If considering pharmacotherapy to target symptom(s) of personality disorder, use shared decision making with the patient, and discuss the potential benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy. Consider the risk of drug dependence, abuse and overdose, and whether adherence to treatment may be an issue. Avoid using a drug that can be fatal in overdose because there is a high risk of overdose with prescribed drugs in people with severe personality disorder. Avoid using a drug to treat personality disorder in the perinatal period—see Considerations in managing personality disorder in the perinatal period. If a drug is required, see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding for considerations.
Before trialling a drug, the patient and prescriber should discuss and reach agreement on the parameters of the trial, including the target symptom(s), how the patient’s response to the drug will be monitored and measured, and the expected duration of treatment.
If pharmacotherapy is used to target symptom(s) of personality disorder, choose a drug that is expected to have efficacy against the target symptom(s) and consider seeking advice from a psychiatrist. If response to the drug is inadequate, withdraw the drug and consider alternate treatment options (either psychosocial or pharmacological). If using a second (or subsequent) drug, use sequential monotherapy—avoid polypharmacy, which is common among people with severe personality disorder.
Despite the widespread use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), evidence does not support their use for dysphoric mood or mood lability caused by personality disorder. Anxiety is a common reason for patients with personality disorder to seek treatment and can cause significant distress. Anxiety as a symptom of personality disorder should be managed in the same way as generalised anxiety disorder. Treatment of anxiety may involve use of an antidepressant for maintenance therapy, or short-term use of a benzodiazepine for anxiety that is severe and disabling, or causing the patient unacceptable distress.
For cognitive-perceptual symptoms, the evidence for pharmacotherapy is unclear. Antipsychotics may have some effect on specific cognitive-perceptual symptoms, but there are no randomised controlled trials of antipsychotics for hallucinations caused by personality disorder. Antipsychotics can cause serious adverse effects, and are associated with abuse. Quetiapine, in particular, is associated with problem use and overdose and, as such, is subject to monitoring by drug diversion monitoring systems in some Australian states. If considering pharmacotherapy for severe or persistent cognitive-perceptual symptoms, seek advice from a psychiatrist.
There is very limited evidence for pharmacotherapy for impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol—seek advice from a psychiatrist before considering pharmacotherapy.
People with personality disorder often present during an acute crisis. Patients usually respond well to being given support and time to talk about their concerns—follow the key principles for working with a patient with personality disorder. Use simple problem-solving strategies to address immediate precipitants and involve the patient’s family, carers or significant others if possible. If these strategies are insufficient to manage the acute crisis, consider using adjunctive short-term pharmacotherapy, with a limited supply of medication, such as:
If a drug is used short term, ensure the patient understands the intended duration of treatment—stop the drug once the acute crisis is resolved.
Using the above principles for managing personality disorder will often prevent acute agitation or behavioural disturbance. However, if symptoms of personality disorder are so severe that the patient is acutely agitated or has an acute behavioural disturbance, do not start treatment before determining that it is safe and appropriate to intervene. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated or at risk of harming themselves or others, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for advice on drug therapy."

Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
For advice on the approach to management of acute behavioural disturbance, see here.
For the management of acute agitation and altered mental state in palliative care, see the specific topic here.
Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults is often required to reduce the risk of significant harm to self and others, and to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the patient. This is especially relevant if nonpharmacological management techniques, such as environmental management (adaption), verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention and risk mitigation, have not adequately defused or settled the situation.
If the patient has differentiated precipitating or predisposing factors for their acute behavioural disturbance, prioritise and optimise treatment of those underlying factors. If the patient has an existing behavioural support plan, use their individualised plan as a guide [Note 1].
In an adult with communication difficulties (eg suspected cognitive impairment or developmental disability), it can be difficult to distinguish behavioural disturbance related to severe acute pain from behavioural disturbance related to another cause. If unrecognised pain is thought to be a potential precipitant of distress and behavioural disturbance, a trial of analgesia is a reasonable first-line treatment rather than a sedative drug.
A Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT) score can assist clinical decision making about whether sedation is required—Table 8.1 provides an example of a sedation assessment tool. The SAT score can be used to assess the imminent risk of significant harm to the patient and others, and provide guidance to the clinician on whether repeat doses of sedative drugs are required. Consider the SAT score in the context of the situation, and the patient’s baseline function and communication style (eg loud outbursts may be usual for individuals with cognitive impairment or developmental disability).
Continue nonpharmacological management techniques alongside any sedation regimen, both before and after drug administration.
The oral route of sedative drug administration is preferred for an adult with acute behavioural disturbance when there is low imminent risk of significant harm to the patient or others (see Box 8.6), the patient’s level of agitation and distress is not severe (eg SAT score +1) and they are accepting of oral medication. The oral route is preferred over parenteral administration because it:
The intramuscular route of sedative drug administration may be used for an adult with acute severe behavioural disturbance if all the following apply:
Intramuscular sedation should only be used in a setting in which staff are trained in the use of intramuscular sedation and its possible complications, and appropriate equipment and expertise to monitor the patient are available.
If immediate control of the situation is required and first-line intramuscular sedative drugs have failed to control the situation, intramuscular rescue sedation can be considered. Rarely, when immediate control of an immediately life-threatening situation is required, emergency intramuscular ketamine sedation can be used first line for rapid sedation. This is only applicable in extreme circumstances and under instruction from a senior clinician.
The intramuscular route is preferred over the intravenous route for parenteral drug administration. The intravenous route of sedative drug administration should only be used for an adult with acute severe behavioural disturbance if all the following apply:
Intravenous sedation should only be used in a setting in which staff are trained in the use of intravenous sedation and its possible complications, and appropriate equipment and expertise to monitor the patient are available.
If intravenous sedation is being considered for an adult, seek advice from a senior clinician. Most emergency departments and hospitals have protocols for the safe use of parenteral sedation, especially via the intravenous route—follow local protocols or consensus state guidelines if available.

Potential harms of pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults
Pharmacological management for adults with acute behavioural disturbance can be associated with potential harms. If pharmacological management is used, consider seeking expert advice, and always monitor the patient closely for adverse drug effects; see Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance for more information.
Potential harms that are associated with sedative drugs include:
Oversedation, causing unconsciousness and loss of protective airway reflexes, is an emergency—if this occurs, seek expert assistance to manage the airway and breathing urgently according to advanced life support protocols [Note 2]. This is rare after oral sedative drug administration—complications are more likely after parenteral administration of sedative drugs.
Some patients have a higher risk of adverse effects after sedative drug administration, including:

Oral drug regimens for acute behavioural disturbance in adults
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
The indications for oral sedation for acute behavioural disturbance in adults are detailed here.
The aim of pharmacological management is to calm the patient with a sufficient initial dose of a sedative drug. Repeated subtherapeutic doses that are inadequate to reduce the patient’s distress and calm their behaviour can prolong the risk of harm to the patient or others. This can also result in larger cumulative doses, or multiple drug administration, both of which increase the risk of adverse drug effects. Monitor the patient closely for adverse drug effects; see Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance for detailed advice.
The most common drugs used in adults to manage acute behavioural disturbance are benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, which are used in this setting for their sedative effects. The sedative effects of antipsychotic drugs occur much sooner than the antipsychotic effects. If the patient has had a previous paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines, or is tolerant to benzodiazepines, avoid benzodiazepines.
When selecting a suitable dose and regimen for a sedative drug, consider patient factors, such as their level of agitation and distress (eg measured with a Sedation Assessment Tool [SAT] score), age, body size, sex, comorbidities, drug history, previous response to sedative drugs and response to treatment.
If oral sedation is indicated for an adult with acute behavioural disturbance, in combination with nonpharmacological techniques, use:
Repeating the SAT score can be useful to determine whether sedation has been effective or if a repeat dose is needed. Individualise the target SAT score based on patient factors (eg response to nonpharmacological interventions, whether the patient needs to be sedated for investigations) and the ability to maintain patient and staff safety.
Always monitor the patient closely for potential adverse effects after administering a sedative drug for an acute behavioural disturbance (especially in drug-naive patients).

Intramuscular drug regimens for acute severe behavioural disturbance in adults
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
The indications for intramuscular sedation for acute severe behavioural disturbance in adults are detailed here.
Most emergency departments and hospitals have protocols for the safe use of parenteral sedation—follow local protocols or consensus state guidelines where available. If intramuscular sedation is used, monitor the patient closely for adverse drug effects. For information about minimum monitoring and equipment requirements, see Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance. In community settings (especially in rural and remote areas) if the minimum monitoring and equipment requirements are not available, a senior clinician needs to make a risk assessment of the situation proportionate to the risk of the sedative drug.

The SAT score can be used to determine whether sedation has been effective, or a repeat dose is needed. Individualise the target SAT score based on patient factors (eg response to nonpharmacological interventions, whether the patient needs to be sedated for investigations) and the ability to maintain patient and staff safety. Rarely, when immediate control of the situation is required and the chosen regimen (above) has failed to achieve control, rescue sedation can be considered.
If droperidol or olanzapine are not accessible, haloperidol may be used as an alternative to droperidol, at the same dose range; however, haloperidol is less effective than the drugs recommended above and may cause significant extrapyramidal adverse effects and QT-interval prolongation with risk of arrhythmias. Intramuscular chlorpromazine is not recommended as a sedative drug for this indication as it causes hypotension.
If an adult patient is being physically restrained to facilitate pharmacological management, continue restraint until a clinical response to the sedative is apparent (ie the patient is calm but rousable). Titrate any additional doses of intramuscular sedative drugs with caution because people who are restrained are more susceptible to adverse effects.
Always monitor the patient closely for potential adverse effects after administering an intramuscular sedative drug.
Rarely, when immediate control of the situation is required, and first-line intramuscular sedative drugs have failed to control the situation, intramuscular rescue sedation can be considered. Intramuscular ketamine or an intramuscular benzodiazepine can be used for rescue sedation. This is in addition to the initial sedative drug used. There is a high risk of airway compromise requiring intubation if intramuscular sedatives are used in combination—always seek advice from a senior clinician.
If rescue sedation is required for an adult who is not frail or cachectic, use:

Intravenous drug regimens for acute severe behavioural disturbance in adults
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
The indications for intravenous sedation for acute severe behavioural disturbance in adults are detailed here.
Most emergency departments and hospitals have protocols for the safe use of parenteral sedation, especially via the intravenous route—follow local protocols or consensus state guidelines, if available. If intravenous sedation is administered, monitor the patient 1:1 for adverse drug effects; see Principles of monitoring a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.

If intravenous sedation is indicated for an adult with acute severe behavioural disturbance, who has existing intravenous access, and in combination with nonpharmacological techniques, use:
Olanzapine is not approved for intravenous use in Australia [Note 11].
If the sedative drugs above are unavailable or fail to control the situation, intravenous ketamine can be considered; however, there is a high risk of airway compromise requiring intubation if combination intravenous pharmacotherapy or rescue sedation is used—always seek advice from a senior clinician regarding the dose and safety of intravenous ketamine.
If an adult patient is being physically restrained, continue restraint until a clinical response to the sedative is apparent (ie the patient is calm but rousable).
Always monitor the patient closely for potential adverse effects after administering an intravenous sedative drug."
pharmacological-acute-behavioural-disturbance-children,"Role of pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in children
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
For advice on the approach to management of acute behavioural disturbance, see here.
If the child has cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, they are more likely to have unmet needs (eg pain, hunger, thirst, toileting needs). Acute behavioural disturbance in a child can often be managed by addressing unmet needs, and by using nonpharmacological management techniques, such as environmental management (adaption), verbal de-escalation and psychological interventions, and risk mitigation.
If the child has differentiated precipitating or predisposing factors contributing to their acute behavioural disturbance, prioritise and optimise treatment of those underlying factors. If the child has a known psychiatric, medical or neurodevelopmental condition, consider their regular medication and check whether they have an existing behavioural support plan [Note 1]—this information may adjust the immediate approach to pharmacological management.
Pharmacological management is less often required in children than in adults, as the potential risk of significant harm to self or others is lower in children. The effects of psychoactive drugs on developing brains is not without risk and it is better to avoid psychotropics in children up to 18 years of age.
When deciding upon a suitable dose regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12 year olds are metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults).
In a child with communication difficulties (eg suspected cognitive impairment or developmental disability), it can be difficult to distinguish behavioural disturbance related to severe acute pain from behavioural disturbance related to another cause. If unrecognised pain is thought to be a potential precipitant of distress and behavioural disturbance, a trial of analgesia is a reasonable first-line treatment rather than a sedative drug.
If nonpharmacological management techniques (eg environmental management [adaption], verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, risk mitigation), have not adequately defused or settled the situation, consider pharmacological management with an oral sedative drug. Seek advice from a senior clinician before using sedation in a child.
A Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT) score may assist clinical decision making about whether sedation is required; however, the SAT score has not been validated for use in children. In children and people with developmental disability, if considering using the SAT score, consider the score in the context of the patient’s baseline function and communication style. Table 8.1 provides an example of a sedation assessment tool.
Continue nonpharmacological management techniques alongside any sedation regimen, both before and after drug administration.
The oral route of sedative drug administration is preferred for children with acute behavioural disturbance when there is low imminent risk of significant harm to the patient or others, the patient’s level of agitation and distress is not severe, and they are accepting of oral medication. The oral route is preferred over parenteral administration for children because:
It is rare to use parenteral sedative drugs for a child, though parenteral sedation may be necessary for a child with acute behavioural disturbance associated with substance use or a psychiatric disorder. The intramuscular route of sedative drug administration may be indicated if all of the following apply:
Intramuscular sedation for children should only be used in a setting in which staff are trained in the use of intramuscular sedation and its possible complications, and appropriate equipment and expertise to monitor the patient are available.
In community settings (especially in rural and remote areas) intramuscular sedation for children is rarely indicated outside of a life-threatening situation. If the minimum monitoring and equipment requirements are not available a senior clinician needs to make a risk assessment of the situation proportionate to the risk of the sedative drug.

The choice of antipsychotic depends on the situation and individual patient factors. Droperidol is more sedating than olanzapine and is preferred for its rapid effect in highly agitated or drug-affected young people; olanzapine is shorter acting than droperidol and is preferred for a younger child who needs to be settled, but requires a full assessment within an hour.

Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
For advice on the approach to management of acute behavioural disturbance, see here.
For the management of acute agitation and altered mental state in palliative care, see the specific topic here.
Older people are more likely than other adults to have predisposing medical conditions that contribute to, or precipitate, distress and acute behavioural disturbance. In addition, if the patient has cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, they are more likely to have unmet needs. Acute behavioural disturbance in older people can often be managed by addressing unmet needs (eg pain, hunger, thirst, toileting needs), and by using nonpharmacological management techniques, such as environmental management (adaption), verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention and risk mitigation. Pharmacological management is often not required if sufficient effort is put into these techniques first.
If the older person has differentiated precipitating or predisposing factors for their acute behavioural disturbance, prioritise and optimise treatment of those underlying factors. If the patient has an existing behavioural support plan, use their individualised plan as a guide [Note 1]. Existing conditions or medications may influence the choice of pharmacological management (eg Lewy body dementia, Parkinson disease). Sometimes pharmacological management is part of a patient’s existing behavioural support plan.
Behavioural disturbance in older people is most often associated with delirium or behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), for which drug therapy is rarely used to manage symptoms. Clinicians who manage acute behavioural disturbance in older people require adequate training in the diagnosis and management of delirium and BPSD, and in nonpharmacological management of acute behavioural disturbance. Only use the drug recommendations for sedation in this topic if the acute behavioural disturbance is severe and there is an imminent risk of harm to the patient or others, and the required expertise and equipment is available.
In an older person with communication difficulties (eg suspected cognitive impairment), it can be difficult to distinguish behavioural disturbance related to severe acute pain from behavioural disturbance related to another cause.

Consider the oral route of sedative drug administration when there is low imminent risk of significant harm to self or others (see Box 8.6), or the patient’s level of agitation and distress is not severe (eg SAT score +1) or is moderately severe (eg SAT score +2) and they are accepting of oral medication.

Repeated subtherapeutic doses that are inadequate to reduce the patient’s distress and calm their behaviour can prolong the risk of harm to the patient or others. This can also result in larger cumulative doses, or multiple drug administration, both of which increase the risk of adverse drug effects, especially in older people. If oral sedation is administered, monitor the patient closely for adverse effects of drugs, including increased risk of falls; see Principles of monitoring a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
When selecting a dose and regimen of a sedative drug for an older person, consider patient factors, such as their level of agitation and distress (eg measured with a Sedation Assessment Tool [SAT] score), age, body size, sex, comorbidities, drug history, previous response to sedative drugs and response to treatment. In older people with cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, consider the SAT score in the context of the patient’s baseline function and communication style (eg loud outbursts may be usual for individuals with dementia).
The most common drugs used in older people to manage acute behavioural disturbance are benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, which are used for their sedative effects. The sedative effects of antipsychotics occur much sooner than the antipsychotic effects. Although oral antipsychotics (eg haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone) are sometimes used for delirium, and BPSD, oral benzodiazepines are preferred to oral antipsychotics to manage acute behavioural disturbance in older people. This is because relatively higher doses of oral antipsychotics than oral benzodiazepines are required to achieve sedation, and serious adverse effects are more likely to occur in an older person (eg hypotension, QT-interval prolongation).
For an older person, lower doses of benzodiazepines are recommended than for other adults; when a dose range is given in the drug recommendations below, it is advisable that clinicians consider choosing a dose at the lower end of the range initially. The pharmacodynamic response to benzodiazepines can be variable in older people. Suitable oral benzodiazepines for older patients are lorazepam or diazepam. Lorazepam may be safer than diazepam for older people, who often have medical comorbidities such as kidney or liver impairment, because lorazepam does not have active metabolites. Diazepam has active metabolites, which prolong its duration of action after a single dose. Clonazepam is generally not recommended for older people because of its very long half-life.
If oral sedation is indicated for an older adult with undifferentiated acute behavioural disturbance, in combination with nonpharmacological techniques, use:
Repeating the SAT score can be useful to determine whether sedation has been effective or if a repeat dose is needed. Individualise the target SAT score based on patient factors (eg response to nonpharmacological interventions, whether the patient needs to be sedated for investigations) and the ability to maintain patient and staff safety.
Always monitor the patient closely for potential adverse effects after administering a sedative drug for acute behavioural disturbance (especially in drug-naive patients). Older people who have been administered sedation are at increased risk of falls and require continuous clinical observation.

Intramuscular drug regimens for acute severe behavioural disturbance in older people
Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.
The indications for intramuscular sedation for acute severe behavioural disturbance in older people are detailed here.
Behavioural disturbance in older people is most often associated with delirium or behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), for which drug therapy is rarely required to manage symptoms—see here for detailed advice about the management of delirium, and here for the management of BPSD. Clinicians who manage acute behavioural disturbance in older people require adequate training in the diagnosis and management of delirium and BPSD, and in nonpharmacological management of acute behavioural disturbance. Only use the drug recommendations for sedation in this topic if the acute behavioural disturbance is severe and there is an imminent risk of harm to the patient or others, and the required expertise and equipment is available.
Most emergency departments and hospitals have protocols for the safe use of parenteral sedation—follow local protocols or consensus state guidelines if available. If intramuscular sedation is used in older people, monitor the patient closely for adverse effects of drugs, including increased risk of falls. For information about minimum monitoring and equipment requirements, see Principles of monitoring a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. In community settings (especially in rural and remote areas) if the minimum monitoring and equipment requirements are not available, a senior clinician needs to make a risk assessment of the situation proportionate to the risk of the sedative drug.
If pharmacological therapy is required in an older person, oral sedation is preferred. Use of parenteral sedation for acute behavioural disturbance in older people should only be considered in exceptional situations, when nonpharmacological interventions have failed, because it is accompanied by a higher relative risk of iatrogenic complications. 
The aim of pharmacological management is to calm the patient with a sufficient initial dose of a sedative drug. Repeated subtherapeutic doses that are inadequate to reduce the patient’s distress and calm their behaviour can prolong the risk of harm to the patient or others. This can also result in larger cumulative doses, or multiple drug administration, both of which increase the risk of adverse drug effects, especially in older people.
When selecting a dose and regimen of a sedative drug for an older person, consider patient factors, such as their level of agitation and distress (eg measured with a Sedation Assessment Tool [SAT] score), age, body size, sex, comorbidities, drug history, previous response to sedative drugs and response to treatment. In older people with cognitive impairment or communication difficulties, consider the SAT score in the context of the patient’s baseline function and communication style (eg loud outbursts may be usual for individuals with dementia).
Antipsychotic drugs are used to manage acute severe behavioural disturbance in older people for their sedative effects. The sedative effects of antipsychotic drugs occur much sooner than the antipsychotic effects. The evidence to support the efficacy and safety of intramuscular antipsychotics in older people with acute severe behavioural disturbance is limited and further research is required; in older people, adverse drug effects are more likely to be prolonged compared with other adults, increasing potential iatrogenic complications. Intramuscular antipsychotics should only be used in a setting in which staff are trained in the use of intramuscular sedation and its possible complications, and appropriate equipment and expertise to monitor the patient are available.
Antipsychotics, including droperidol and olanzapine, can aggravate motor features in Parkinson disease or Lewy body dementia. In an acute severe behavioural disturbance, if Parkinson disease or Lewy body dementia are suspected, seek expert advice regarding drug choice.
If intramuscular sedation is indicated for an older person with undifferentiated acute severe behavioural disturbance, in combination with nonpharmacological techniques, use:
Repeating the SAT score can be useful to determine whether sedation has been effective or if a repeat dose is needed. Individualise the target SAT score based on patient factors (eg response to nonpharmacological interventions, whether the patient needs to be sedated for investigations) and the ability to maintain patient and staff safety.
If droperidol and olanzapine are not accessible, haloperidol may be used as an alternative; however, haloperidol is less effective and may cause significant extrapyramidal adverse effects and QT-interval prolongation with risk of arrhythmias. Intramuscular chlorpromazine is not recommended as a sedative drug for acute behavioural disturbance because it causes hypotension.
If the antipsychotics above are unavailable or fail to control the situation, seek advice from a senior clinician.
In the rare event that an older person is physically restrained, continue restraint for the shortest duration possible. Titrate any additional doses of intramuscular sedative drugs with extreme caution because people who are restrained are more susceptible to adverse effects.
Always monitor the patient closely for potential adverse effects after administering an intramuscular sedative drug. Older people who have been administered sedation are at increased risk of adverse effects including falls and require continuous clinical observation."
postpartum-psychosis,"Postpartum psychosis
Postpartum psychosis is a rare but dangerous condition, associated with significant risk of suicide and infanticide—it is a psychiatric emergency. Symptoms are acute and include agitation, confusion, disorganised thoughts, sleep disturbance, hallucinations, delusions and abnormal mood. Risk factors include a previous episode of postpartum psychosis and a history of bipolar disorder (including a family history). A first episode of postpartum psychosis can evolve into bipolar disorder.
Postpartum psychosis should be treated by a psychiatrist in a specialised centre. Typically, an antipsychotic is used, although in complex cases, lithium and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be required.
For advice on psychotropic use in breastfeeding, see here.
Patients who have had an episode of postpartum psychosis are at increased risk of further episodes in subsequent pregnancies. Once they have recovered from psychosis, discuss this risk with them; see Preventing postpartum psychosis.

Preventing postpartum psychosis
Postpartum psychosis often reoccurs after subsequent births. If a person with a history of postpartum psychosis becomes pregnant, seek psychiatric advice early to form a postpartum psychosis prevention plan. The plan should include prevention strategies and postpartum mental state monitoring. Limited evidence supports offering lithium or an antipsychotic late in the third trimester or immediately after birth (within 1 day postpartum). The drug that was previously effective for postpartum psychosis is usually the drug of choice. Also consider whether the patient wishes to breastfeed; antipsychotics may be used while breastfeeding whereas lithium should not be used.
If the patient has not had an episode of postpartum psychosis by 3 months postpartum, seek psychiatric advice to slowly reduce then stop the drug."
principles-of-antipsychotic-use,"Principles of antipsychotic use
Antipsychotics have been classified in different ways (eg typical and atypical, first generation and second generation), but these classifications are not pharmacologically meaningful and are not used in these guidelines.
The dose of antipsychotic required to achieve the best balance of effectiveness and adverse effects varies considerably between individuals. Using higher than recommended doses rarely improves symptoms but is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects. However, a psychiatrist may exceed the recommended dose range in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and increased doses of olanzapine (up to 30 mg daily) may be used for short-term treatment of agitation.
Combining antipsychotics increases the risk of adverse effects. Only use only one antipsychotic at a time unless:
If a patient uses more than one antipsychotic, seek specialist advice about transitioning to monotherapy; this may not always be possible for patients with psychotic disorders.
For additional information on antipsychotic use, see:"
principles-of-MAOIs,"Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can cause significant hypertension when combined with indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines (eg phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, phentermine, methylphenidate, amfetamines) or certain foods (see Table 8.30 for dietary guidelines)—avoid concurrent administration. A throbbing headache (usually occipital) is the first symptom; any hypertensive episode should be treated urgently (see Urgent control of blood pressure).
Directly acting sympathomimetic amines (eg adrenaline [epinephrine], dopamine, isoprenaline, noradrenaline [norepinephrine]) are inactivated primarily by catechol-O-methyltransferase, not monoamine oxidase; they can be used cautiously in combination with a MAOI while monitoring blood pressure.
For a detailed listing of drug interactions with MAOIs, see the product information for individual drugs or an appropriate reference (eg Stockley’s Drug Interactions). Always check for drug interactions before prescribing.
Avoid administration of MAOIs with other serotonergic drugs because there is an increased risk of serotonin toxicity (see Table 11.5 for drugs that have been associated with serotonin toxicity).

Dietary guidelines for nonselective MAOIs
Tyramine is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic metabolised by monoamine oxidase enzymes. The irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), phenelzine and tranylcypromine, may cause significant hypertension when combined with foods containing large amounts of tyramine; see Tyramine reaction. For foods to avoid when taking irreversible nonselective MAOIs, see Table 8.30.
Interactions with tyramine-containing foods are unlikely at recommended doses of moclobemide, a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A), as tyramine is also metabolised by monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B). Risk of interaction is further minimised by taking moclobemide after meals. However, when used at higher than recommended doses, moclobemide also inhibits MAO-B and dietary restrictions are warranted (see Table 8.30).

principles-treating-psychoses,"Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia in adults and young people
Although most data that inform advice in this topic come from studies conducted in people with schizophrenia, this topic is intended to apply to all psychotic disorders. It is reasonable to extrapolate the data from schizophrenia because psychosis spectrum disorders respond to similar treatments and there is a lack of evidence for targeted treatment.
The aims of treating psychoses including schizophrenia are to:
To achieve these aims, use a multifaceted treatment approach that is individualised based on:
Multifaceted treatment over the first 5 years maximise recovery, but continued access to a range of interventions appears to be necessary to maintain this effect [Note 2]. Although treatment should be individualised, the following should always be components of treatment:
It is particularly important to actively engage with a patient who has psychosis because the disorder can impair their insight, motivation and cognition. Care may need to be assertively provided with the assistance of a community mental health team.
Patient resources include:
When treating a young person with psychosis, also consider:
Discuss contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use with a female of childbearing potential who has a psychotic disorder; patients with schizophrenia have a higher rate of unintended pregnancies. See Psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential for advice and information about the effect of antipsychotic therapy on fertility.
Although most of the outcome data mentioned in this section come from studies conducted in patients with schizophrenia. this section is intended to apply to all psychotic disorders. It is reasonable to extrapolate the data from schizophrenia because psychosis spectrum disorders respond to similar treatments and there is a lack of evidence for targeted treatment.
Patients with psychotic disorders are at increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes such as low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational age infants, preterm labour and placental abruption. Some of these outcomes are partially attributable to increased rates of smoking, problem drug use, poor nutrition and lower socioeconomic status among this population. The psychotic disorder may in itself be a risk factor for minor congenital abnormalities in offspring.
Patients with psychotic disorders have higher rates of custody loss compared with patients with other psychiatric disorders. Maternal psychotic disorders have also been associated with increased risk of neonatal mortality.
These adverse outcomes must be considered and weighed against the potential harms of antipsychotic use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Patients with a psychotic disorder have the best chance of parenting their infant in the long term if their disorder is well controlled with low residual symptoms, and if they have a partner or another highly supportive person to assist in parenting.
Managing a patient with a psychotic disorder during the perinatal period is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach including the patient’s general practitioner, psychiatrist (preferably with perinatal expertise), and obstetric team, and a paediatrician. If possible, refer the patient to a specialist perinatal mental health service. The approach to treating psychoses including schizophrenia is not different in the perinatal period. In fact, robust rather than undertreatment is in the best interest of the patient and their child because of the increased risk of poor psychiatric, obstetric and parenting outcomes.
Patients with psychotic disorders should ideally give birth in a tertiary referral hospital with a specialist neonatal care unit and psychiatric team. If this is not possible, seek advice from the patient’s psychiatrist and a paediatrician.
Do not stop an antipsychotic abruptly because of the increased risk of relapse. The decision to continue antipsychotics should be made after weighing up the relatively uncertain harms associated with antipsychotic exposure in the perinatal period (see Antipsychotic use in pregnancy and Antipsychotic use while breastfeeding) and the harms associated with relapse, including psychiatric admission and exposure to polypharmacy during acute treatment.

Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia in children
The principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia in children are similar to the principles of treating adults and young people; however:

Managing negative symptoms in psychoses including schizophrenia
Negative symptoms are a significant cause of long-term disability in schizophrenia because they respond poorly to treatment with most antipsychotics.
Ensure antipsychotic therapy is optimised and take the following steps to address negative symptoms:
If negative symptoms persist despite these interventions, contact the patient’s psychiatrist for advice. The choice of therapy depends on the patient’s comorbidities and treatment history; for example, if depressive symptoms are prominent, combining an antipsychotic with an antidepressant (particularly a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor [SNRI]) may improve secondary negative symptoms. If monotherapy is used, amisulpride has the best evidence of efficacy for negative symptoms.

Psychosocial interventions for psychoses including schizophrenia
In addition to antipsychotic therapy, psychological and psychosocial interventions are essential to treating psychotic disorders, but most people with psychotic disorders do not receive adequate psychosocial interventions. Psychosocial interventions are particularly important to treat cognitive and negative symptoms, which are minimally affected by antipsychotics.
Provide psychoeducation to all patients and their family members, carers or significant others. Also assess whether the patient requires other psychosocial interventions including:
Psychoeducation involves educating the patient and their family, carers or significant others about:
Psychoeducation is usually provided over a number of sessions, either in a group format or one-to-one.
Assertive community treatment describes the collaborative, community-based care of a person with a severe psychiatric disorder by a team of mental health professionals who provide a broad range of psychosocial interventions. These may include assistance with antipsychotic adherence, social skills training, welfare support, financial planning, health promotion, housing and counselling.
Behavioural therapy aims to identify and alter dysfunctional behaviours by modifying factors that reinforce the behaviours and their consequences. Behavioural therapy is especially useful to structure the day of a person with significant negative symptoms to increase their level of activity and self-care. This type of treatment uses similar techniques to social skills training.
Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) helps patients cope with persistent hallucinations or delusions by asking them to examine the evidence for a psychotic belief, and use reasoning, coping and problem-solving skills to challenge and decrease its significance and threat. CBTp should be delivered by a clinician trained in CBTp and may be combined with CBT for comorbid psychiatric disorders (eg anxiety or depression). See also Cognitive behavioural therapy.
Cognitive remediation therapies (including social cognitive remediation therapy) address cognitive deficits by supporting patients to practise and improve their cognitive abilities. These treatments are provided in many formats (eg pen and paper, computer-assisted, web-based, face-to-face in individual or group settings). Although cognitive remediation therapies can significantly improve cognitive deficits, they must be integrated with other psychosocial interventions to improve daily function.
For patients with problem substance use, motivational interviewing combined with targeted cognitive behavioural therapy for substance use disorder reduces rates of psychotic relapse. It also improves functioning within the community and treatment adherence. There may be greater benefit if treatment of the psychotic disorder and problem substance use are integrated and administered by a multidisciplinary team.
Social skills training aims to improve basic social functioning, and performance and interpersonal skills. It uses a variety of strategies (eg goal setting, increased structure or routine in the day, rehearsal of activities, role modelling, feedback, positive reinforcement) to improve social interaction. Importantly, it is effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Cognitive adaptive training compensates for the cognitive deficits of people with schizophrenia with an individualised treatment plan that focuses on activities of daily living and basic social skills.
People with psychotic disorders experience high levels of unemployment. Supported employment and education (Individual Placement and Support [IPS]) involves a vocational specialist working with the person to source employment or education. The vocational specialist provides ongoing support to try to keep the person in employment or education. Supported employment is most effective if the vocational specialist is part of the person’s mental health team.

Identifying and treating comorbidities in people with psychoses including schizophrenia
People with psychotic disorders tend to die earlier and have higher rates of comorbidities (especially cardiometabolic disease) than the general population because of:
To reduce rates of early morbidity and mortality, identify and manage chronic conditions (eg cardiometabolic and respiratory diseases).
Table 8.20 lists common comorbidities in patients with psychotic disorders, and strategies to prevent and treat them.
Comorbidity
Prevention strategies
Treatment strategies
cardiometabolic disease [NB1]
avoid using an antipsychotic with significant cardiometabolic adverse effects (see Table 8.31)
encourage the patient to stop smoking [NB2]
support the patient to eat a healthy diet and undertake regular physical activity [NB3] [NB4] [NB5]
reduce alcohol intake
help the patient to maintain a healthy weight
preventive strategies are also treatments—also see Cardiometabolic adverse effects
osteoporosis and fractures
see Preventing a minimal-trauma fracture for advice
see Considerations before treating osteoporosis for advice
poor dental health
maintain good oral hygiene
undergo annual dental assessments
see the Oral and Dental guidelines for treatment of oral and dental conditions
respiratory
encourage the patient to stop smoking [NB2] and avoid second-hand smoke exposure
see the Respiratory guidelines for treatment of respiratory conditions
sleep disorders
assess the patient’s sleep (including for obstructive sleep apnoea)
encourage the patient to practice good sleep hygiene
see treatment advice for insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders and parasomnias in the Psychotropic guidelines, and obstructive sleep apnoea here
depression and anxiety
use psychosocial interventions to decrease isolation
support the patient to eat a healthy diet and undertake regular physical activity [NB3] [NB4] [NB5]
monitor for substance use that can increase risk of depression
depression and anxiety may settle with acute psychosis treatment. If depression or anxiety persists, or develops after this period, see Assessing a person with depressive symptoms or Assessing a person with anxiety
approximately 5% of patients with schizophrenia die by suicide. The risk is highest early in the course of disorder and in patients with comorbid depression—closely monitor and assess for thoughts of self-harm and suicide
problem use of alcohol, cannabis or other illicit substances
monitor for problem substance use
inform the patient that problem substance use can lead to increased hospital admissions, drug interactions, reduced antipsychotic responsiveness, and increased risk of relapse, self-harm, arrest and accommodation problems
treat problem substance use and the psychotic disorder concurrently with an integrated treatment program; see Alcohol and other drug problems and Psychosocial interventions for psychoses including schizophrenia

Support for families, carers and significant others of people with psychoses including schizophrenia
Families, carers and significant others play a central role in the treatment of people with psychoses including schizophrenia by providing social and emotional support, financial assistance and a stable, secure living environment.
It is essential for the patient and their family members, carers or significant others to engage in a psychoeducation program to promote a working understanding of the disorder; this can reduce the patient’s risk of relapse.
Family therapy assists with the pressures of caring for a person with a psychotic disorder, which can cause considerable dysfunction, hostility and conflict within families. It can help family members understand and cope with their relative’s disorder, decrease hostility and conflict, and develop better ways of dealing with the effects of the disorder. Family therapy usually includes psychoeducation, a behavioural approach to changing problematic behaviours, problem solving and relapse prevention planning, and is provided either to a single family or in multifamily groups.
Families, carers and significant others need assistance and support from mental health services, carer support groups and health care professionals. Carer assistance programs can provide support, education and respite care. Useful resources include:"
prophylaxis-bipolar-disorder,"Principles of prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in adults and young people
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.
Prophylaxis of bipolar disorder aims to prevent future episodes and enhance resilience. Most patients with bipolar disorder have multiple mood episodes. Over 90% of patients with mania will have multiple recurrences of mania. Most patients experience recurrent episodes of depression in addition to manic or hypomanic episodes.
Evaluate the need for prophylaxis on a case-by-case basis, using a shared decision-making process with the patient and involving the treating psychiatrist. Discuss the benefits and harms of treatment with the patient. Prophylaxis is usually considered necessary if the patient has had either:
If there was a sufficient response to the drug used for acute therapy, use the same drug for prophylaxis; the effective dose or target blood concentration may be lower than when the drug was used for acute treatment. If a patient is stabilised on and adherent to an oral antipsychotic, to minimise the risk of adverse effects, slowly reduce to the lowest effective dose; see Box 8.42 for approach. Also offer the option of switching to a long-acting injectable formulation, but do not insist upon switching if the patient is tolerating their oral antipsychotic.
Table 8.6 outlines the drugs used for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and their efficacy in preventing manic and depressive episodes. If the patient has bipolar I disorder (ie at least one prior episode of mania) they will require a drug effective in preventing future episodes of mania. While monotherapy is preferred, sometimes more than one drug is required to achieve optimal response.
The choice of drug may also be influenced by the propensity of the preferred treatment to cause adverse effects. Drug therapy is usually prolonged, so consider tolerability carefully.
Antipsychotic choice, in particular, needs to balance efficacy and tolerability (consider both short- and long-term adverse effects). If prophylaxis with an antipsychotic is being considered, discuss antipsychotic choice with the patient and, if they consent, their significant others, family or carers using the discussion points here.
Consult a drug information source for advice on contraindications, precautions, adverse effects, dosage adjustments, clinical monitoring requirements before and during therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring [Note 1] [Note 2]. Drug therapy is usually prolonged, so consider tolerability carefully. Monitor patients for adverse effects of drug treatment.
Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40. Dosage should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for antipsychotic adverse effects).

For drug regimens for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder see here.
Discuss the duration of prophylaxis with the patient and, if they consent, their significant others, family or carers. Long-term pharmacotherapy can be associated with significant harms (eg cardiometabolic and other serious adverse effects of antipsychotics). Assess the harm–benefit ratio of these drugs, with consideration that recurrence can also be associated with significant harm. Prophylaxis may be time-limited (3 to 5 years) or indefinite, depending on history of recurrences, response to treatment, patient age and treatment tolerability. If the decision is made to stop prophylaxis, ensure the patient understands the associated risks and provide further psychoeducation. Ensure withdrawal of the drug is gradual and carefully monitored because there is an increased risk of suicide if patients withdraw treatment rapidly. If stopping an antipsychotic, see Stopping an antipsychotic.
If a patient experiences a relapse while on maintenance therapy, see Nonresponse to prophylaxis of bipolar disorder.

Drug regimens for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in adults and young people
See Principles of prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in adults and young people for a discussion of the role of prophylaxis, drug choice and use in specific populations (eg pregnant people, young people).
The drug regimens below describe how to start a drug for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and the recommended dose range; use the lowest effective dose to minimise adverse drug effects. If continuing a drug used for acute therapy, the effective dose or target blood concentration may be lower than when the drug was used for acute treatment.
For prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in adults and young people, use:
For long-acting injectable antipsychotic dose recommendations, see here.

Prophylaxis of bipolar disorder during pregnancy
The management of bipolar disorder in pregnancy is complex—see Considerations in managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy for advice on determining treatment approach.
The recommendations in this section are intended to guide initiation of prophylaxis by a psychiatrist during pregnancy but can be used to guide drug choice if drug therapy needs to be changed in a patient already taking prophylaxis.
When starting prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, consider using the same drug that was effective for acute treatment depending on its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Discuss treatment options with the patient and, if they consent, their significant other(s).
During the first trimester, olanzapine, quetiapine, or, if depression is prominent, lamotrigine are preferred for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder—also see Antipsychotic use during pregnancy and Lamotrigine for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. Lithium is usually avoided during the first trimester because of the increased risk of congenital malformations; however, if the patient only responds to lithium and the likely benefits of using lithium outweigh the potential harms, lithium may be used with close supervision—see Lithium use during pregnancy.
From the second trimester onwards, lithium is preferred for prophylaxis; however, it should not be used while breastfeeding—for advice on managing lithium use during pregnancy see here. If lithium is not used, olanzapine, quetiapine, or, if depression is prominent, lamotrigine are preferred for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder—see drug regimens here. Carbamazepine can be started in the second trimester for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder—see here for advice on carbamazepine use during pregnancy.
Do not start sodium valproate during pregnancy—see here.

Nonresponse to pharmacotherapy for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in adults and young people
If a patient relapses while on pharmacotherapy for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, address any factors in Box 8.19 that could account for relapse.
Consider the following questions if a patient relapses while taking pharmacotherapy for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder.
If optimising the above factors fails to improve response, psychiatrists may use a combination of drugs for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. Although evidence is limited, combinations with some evidence of efficacy include:

Prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in children
For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children].
Bipolar disorder is extremely rare in children and prophylaxis should always be managed by a service with practitioners experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children.
Principles of prophylaxis of bipolar disorder in children are similar to those for adults and young people but there is little evidence to support the efficacy of these interventions in children, and treatment recommendations are extrapolated from evidence in adult populations."
psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders,"What is covered in this topic?
This topic gives an overview of common psychological interventions that are recommended in these guidelines for the management of psychiatric disorders. It does not contain comprehensive information on all psychological interventions.
Psychological interventions are an important treatment component for psychiatric disorders, either as an alternative or adjunct to pharmacotherapy. The choice of psychological intervention depends on the efficacy of specific interventions for the patient’s psychiatric disorder, the typical needs of patients with that psychiatric disorder, and the needs of the individual patient.
Depending on the intervention, psychological interventions may be delivered by a psychiatrist, psychologist, suitably trained general medical practitioner, counsellor, mental health nurse, social worker or other clinician. They can be delivered individually, as part of a group, online or face-to-face. The patient’s primary treating clinician may refer the patient to a suitable clinician for a psychological intervention. Clinicians involved in the multidisciplinary treatment team should communicate to ensure continuity of care.

Acceptance and commitment therapy
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a psychological intervention that has its origins in cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. It focuses on the acceptance of difficult thoughts and emotions that are an inevitable part of life, as well as a commitment towards living life according to values. Acceptance and commitment therapy involves a range of strategies to assist the patient to manage distressing emotions (eg acceptance strategies) and thoughts (eg cognitive defusion techniques), as well as mindful exploration of values and plans for achieving goals.

Cognitive behavioural therapy
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, emotions and behaviours. It is based on the theory that unhelpful or distorted thinking patterns can lead to distressing emotions and maladaptive behaviours, which can then negatively influence a person’s subsequent thoughts or cognitions. Cognitive behavioural therapy helps the patient to identify and target these unhelpful thoughts, emotions and behaviours.
Cognitive behavioural therapy has 2 focuses:
Elements of cognitive behavioural therapy (eg activity scheduling, identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts) can be used individually as a brief form of psychological intervention, particularly in primary care settings.

Dialectical behaviour therapy
Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) involves learning skills to manage emotions and relationships more effectively. The goal of treatment is to assist patients to manage problematic thinking patterns, emotions and ineffective behaviours.
The program teaches skills across 4 modules:

Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) involves the patient focusing their attention on images, thoughts or sensations associated with traumatic memories while simultaneously also focusing on an external stimulus. The external stimulus is most commonly clinician-directed lateral eye movements, although bilateral tactile tapping or auditory stimulation may also be used. Other components of treatment include replacing negative cognitions of the event with more adaptive ones, and relaxation techniques.
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing is guided by the Adaptive Information Processing Model, which postulates that memories formed during traumatic experiences are inadequately processed and when these are recalled, may trigger distressing physiological responses similar to those experienced during the traumatic event itself. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy is believed to result in the traumatic memory being reprocessed into wider memory networks that are more adaptive and less distressing; however, the mechanisms for this process remain uncertain.

Family interventions and family therapy
The family members of a patient with a psychiatric disorder can benefit from support or therapy themselves, to help manage the effects the psychiatric disorder may have on them and the family system.
Family interventions can range from psychoeducation about the patient’s psychiatric disorder, supportive counselling for family members, practical advice on how to support the person experiencing the disorder, and family therapy. Family interventions can be provided by a general medical practitioner, therapist, or other clinician, or as part of a clinician-led group or community support group.
Family therapy may be beneficial if complex relationships and interactions that exist within the family are a contributing factor to the patient’s psychiatric disorder. Family therapy emphasises relationships as an important factor in psychological health. Addressing issues with family therapy can help to improve the patient’s symptoms and the family’s level of functioning. There are a range of family therapy approaches.

Interpersonal therapy
Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is based on the theory that interpersonal problems can contribute to the development of mental health issues. It helps the patient to identify and understand interpersonal problems and how they contribute to negative thoughts and feelings, and implement strategies that improve interpersonal functioning. Interpersonal therapy focuses on 4 areas:

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) incorporates aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as well as mindfulness. Patients take part in mindful meditation practices, and are taught to observe, rather than attempt to change, their thoughts and emotions. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy aims to change how patients relate to their thoughts and feelings. It allows them to experience thoughts and feelings as mental events rather than factual representations of themselves or the world, reducing distress and reactivity to thoughts and feelings.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy
Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on the theory that unknown or unconscious thoughts and emotions can contribute to the problems a person may be experiencing.
Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on:
Psychodynamic psychotherapy can be either short or long term. Short-term psychotherapy (eg 12 to 24 sessions) works through specific internal struggles and interpersonal conflicts, whereas long-term psychotherapy (eg over a period of years) is more intensive and works through a framework of discovering developmental deficits and unconscious conflicts.

Psychoeducation
Psychoeducation involves educating the patient and their family, carers or significant others about:
Psychoeducation is usually provided over a number of sessions, either in a group format or one-to-one.

Relaxation strategies
Relaxation strategies aim to alleviate anxiety, tension and distress, which can enhance general wellbeing and may improve symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
Relaxation strategies can include:

Schema therapy
Schema therapy incorporates aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), attachment theory, psychodynamic psychotherapy and emotion-focused therapies. It aims to address unmet needs experienced in childhood and helps the patient to develop their healthy adult self.
Schema therapy involves:

Online psychological interventions
There are a range of online psychological interventions that can be used in the management of psychiatric disorders. These generally provide a cognitive behavioural therapy–based treatment approach and are a useful option when treatment from a mental health clinician is difficult to access or not accepted by the patient. They can be delivered in various formats (eg an online course, a mobile app), and can be clinician supported or patient led.
Online psychological interventions may be suitable for people who are experiencing mild to moderate mental health issues. Online interventions are not suitable as the main psychological intervention for patients who have more serious mental health issues, including:
Online interventions can be used adjunctively with other interventions. The Head to Health website developed by the Australian Government Department of Health provides access to a range of online mental health interventions and resources."
psychotropic-use-breastfeeding,"What is covered in this topic?
This topic is intended to support the practical implementation of the psychotropic recommendations for nonacute indications in these guidelines. For advice on the use of other drugs during breastfeeding, consult a drug information resource. This topic may be relevant for any person who is breastfeeding; this includes cis women, trans men and nonbinary people.
For information on the use of the following drugs while breastfeeding, see:

Overview of psychotropic breastfeeding data
The recommendations in these guidelines for psychotropic use while breastfeeding are drawn on expert consensus based on evidence of low to moderate quality.
Although there is no reason to suspect that a psychotropic would be ineffective during breastfeeding, there have been no randomised controlled trials, so the effectiveness of psychotropics in this patient group remains unproven. Breastfeeding safety data are limited to observational studies that have significant confounders (eg psychiatric disorder, alcohol and nicotine use) but data quality continues to improve as confounders are more effectively controlled.

Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding
All psychotropics are excreted into breastmilk (albeit to varying degrees)—if a psychotropic is taken while breastfeeding, the infant will be exposed to it. This being said, the placental transfer of most drugs exceeds breastmilk excretion, and, generally, the concentration of the drug in breastmilk is significantly lower than the therapeutic concentration for infants.
The benefits of breastfeeding are sufficiently important to encourage breastfeeding unless there is substantial evidence that the drug will harm the infant and no alternative is available.
Discuss the approach to psychotropic use in breastfeeding with the patient and, if the patient consents, their significant other(s) so they can make an informed choice (see also Shared decision making). There are 4 options to consider:
Table 8.27 provides a framework to help decide whether to use a psychotropic while breastfeeding. Exercise particular caution if the infant is premature, has a low birth weight, is physically ill, or has an impaired ability to metabolise or excrete drugs.
Infant
Patient
Potential harms of psychotropic use
Potential benefits of psychotropic use
There is no risk-neutral or universally applicable treatment for a patient with a psychiatric disorder who is breastfeeding; individualise treatment based on the considerations listed above.
Avoid polypharmacy and drugs with long half-life (eg diazepam) and use the lowest possible dose in patients who are breastfeeding to reduce the risk of accumulation in the breastfed infant. Monitor the infant for excessive sedation, irritability, agitation and gastrointestinal dysfunction (eg colic, poor feeding). However, before attributing these symptoms to a drug, consider alternative causes—there is a high incidence of these problems in all infants. If the infant’s symptoms are severe or clearly caused by the drug, discuss the preferred approach with the parent.
For the latest updates, newsletters and patient handouts on the use of drugs while breastfeeding, see:
The Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential also apply to patients who are breastfeeding.

Antidepressant use while breastfeeding
Consider the advice for antidepressant use while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
The placental transfer and fetal exposure to antidepressants in utero is much greater than breastmilk exposure. Therefore, if a patient has taken an antidepressant during pregnancy, and delivered a healthy neonate, continue the antidepressant while breastfeeding. Do not switch to another antidepressant with a lower breastmilk concentration.
If an antidepressant is started while breastfeeding for a new-onset disorder, use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) other than fluoxetine. Fluoxetine passes into breastmilk to a greater extent than other SSRIs and has along half-life with the potential to accumulate in the breastfed infant. Fluoxetine has been associated with low weight gain, irritability, difficulty settling and infant gastrointestinal dysfunction. Sertraline has the most safety data in breastfeeding and is recommended first line.
No adverse neurological or developmental adverse outcomes have been observed in infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine in breastmilk. Isolated cases of irritability, sleep disturbance and colic, which remitted when breastfeeding or the antidepressant was stopped, have been reported.
Except for doxepin, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are considered safe while breastfeeding. Avoid doxepin; there have been isolated case reports of sedation and respiratory depression in infants. Neurodevelopmental effects of TCA breastmilk exposure are unknown—data are limited.
Moclobemide has very low transfer into breastmilk and may be used with caution. Agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mianserin, mirtazapine, phenelzine, reboxetine, tranylcypromine and vortioxetine have not been adequately studied.
For advice on antidepressant use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Antiepileptic use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding
Consider the advice on antiepileptic use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
Sodium valproate and carbamazepine are considered safe to use while breastfeeding, although sodium valproate should be avoided in females of childbearing potential. Monitor weight gain and alertness in infants.
Although lamotrigine passes into breastmilk in higher and more variable amounts than carbamazepine and sodium valproate, it has not been associated with problematic adverse effects in infants. Lamotrigine can be taken while breastfeeding with close infant monitoring. If the infant develops a rash, stop breastfeeding until the cause is known—exclude Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (although there have been no case reports of this occurring as a result of breastmilk exposure). If there are serious concerns about lamotrigine impacting an infant, seek expert advice and consider monitoring the infant’s lamotrigine blood concentration.
The effect of pregabalin on an infant while breastfeeding is unknown. Limited data suggest that a small amount of pregabalin passes into breastmilk; consider alternative treatments, especially in neonates and premature infants.
For advice on antiepileptic use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Antipsychotic use while breastfeeding
Consider the advice for antipsychotic use while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
Data on antipsychotic use while breastfeeding are limited to case reports and about half of these concern olanzapine. Except for clozapine, antipsychotics appear safe in breastfeeding, but should be used with caution. Avoid breastfeeding with clozapine; it achieves a high concentration in breastmilk and there is a theoretical risk of infant agranulocytosis. Advise the patient to stop breastfeeding and continue clozapine.
Olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone have low infant doses relative to maternal weight-adjusted dose (relative infant dose). Moderate relative infant doses are described for aripiprazole, risperidone and paliperidone. Amisulpride has been associated with high relative infant doses. Adverse events have rarely been reported in infants. At the time of writing, brexpiprazole, lurasidone and asenapine have not been adequately studied.
Haloperidol, chlorpromazine and periciazine, especially at high dose, have occasionally been associated with adverse reactions in breastfed infants (eg urinary retention, dystonic reactions). Using a low dose (ie less than 10 mg haloperidol daily or equivalent), may decrease the risk of adverse reactions.
Reserve long-acting injectable antipsychotics for when there are no other treatment options—if the infant has an adverse reaction, advise the patient to stop breastfeeding.
For advice on antipsychotic use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Benzodiazepine use while breastfeeding
Consider the advice for benzodiazepine use while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
If a benzodiazepine is needed while breastfeeding, if possible, use one with a shorter half-life (eg temazepam, lorazepam). Chronic use of longer-acting benzodiazepines (eg diazepam, clonazepam) can accumulate in a breastfed infant, resulting in ‘floppy infant syndrome’, with symptoms of hypotonia, lethargy and reduced suckling. Exercise caution with benzodiazepine use in the first 4 postnatal days, especially if the neonate has jaundice, because their liver may not be able to adequately metabolise both the benzodiazepine and increased levels of bilirubin.
For advice on benzodiazepine use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Lisdexamfetamine use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding
Consider the advice for lisdexamfetamine use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
Lisdexamfetamine has no breastfeeding safety data; however, the findings for dexamfetamine (its metabolite) may cautiously be applied. Although limited data indicate that dexamfetamine passes into breastmilk, no adverse effects have been reported; use lisdexamfetamine with caution while breastfeeding.
For advice on lisdexamfetamine use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Lithium use while breastfeeding
For a patient in whom the harm–benefit analysis indicates that treatment with lithium is required in the postnatal period, advise against breastfeeding. The passage of lithium into the breastmilk is highly variable and there is a risk of lithium toxicity in the infant, with associated thyroid dysfunction, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Infants can easily become dehydrated, placing them at risk of lithium toxicity. Obtaining infant blood lithium concentrations via venepuncture may be traumatic for the infant and interpretation of the results can be difficult.
Although these guidelines and international consensus do not recommend breastfeeding during lithium therapy, some centres have advocated this practice on the basis. that breastfeeding offers many benefits, and there are limited data of serious harm. If lithium is taken while breastfeeding, the infant must be closely monitored by their paediatrician (if possible, or their general practitioner). Consider regularly monitoring the infant’s kidney and thyroid function and blood lithium concentration.
For advice on lithium use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Melatonin use while breastfeeding
Consider the advice on melatonin use while breastfeeding in accordance with Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.

Suvorexant use while breastfeeding
Avoid suvorexant while breastfeeding because it has no breastfeeding safety data—also consider the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
For advice on suvorexant use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Zolpidem or zopiclone use while breastfeeding
Consider the advice on zolpidem or zopiclone use while breastfeeding along with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
Zolpidem and zopiclone may be used with caution in breastfeeding; case series report low excretion into breastmilk and no short-term adverse outcomes in infants.
For advice on zolpidem and zopiclone use in females of childbearing potential, see here.

Complementary medicine use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding
Although there are no data about the effects of parental omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on breastfed infants; the dietary supplement may be used with caution while breastfeeding.
Avoid St John’s wort while breastfeeding because it has limited breastfeeding safety data—use an alternative therapy.
Consider the advice for use of complementary medicine while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.
For advice on complementary medicine use in females of childbearing potential, see here."
psychotropic-use-children,"Principles of psychotropic use in children
There is limited evidence for the efficacy and safety of psychotropics in children—most trials have small sample sizes and are of short duration, and few are placebo controlled. Consequently, many psychotropics do not have approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in children (see Off-label prescribing for psychiatric disorders).
Data on psychotropic use in adults cannot necessarily be extrapolated to children because of age-related differences in drug metabolism and effect. It is also not known how psychotropics may affect long-term neurodevelopment.
In children who are obese, it may be necessary to use ideal body weight to calculate the appropriate drug dose.
Nonpharmacological treatment is usually preferred in children with psychiatric disorders. If psychotropics are required, they should ideally be started, and reviewed at least 6-monthly, by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. Depending on the disorder and the availability of services, oversight can be provided by a child or youth psychiatrist, a paediatrician, a physician with expertise in paediatric psychopharmacology, or an age-appropriate mental health service.
Set clear, measurable goals for pharmacotherapy. Use symptom checklists, screening questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews to establish the child’s baseline, and repeat the same assessment periodically to determine efficacy and adverse effects. Children often require more frequent review than adults.
Avoid polypharmacy in children unless there is a good rationale for combining drugs, such as using drugs with different mechanisms to target different symptoms or disorders—document the target symptoms of each drug. If polypharmacy is necessary, consult a clinician with expertise in paediatric psychopharmacology.
When using a psychotropic in an older child, obtain informed consent from the child as well as their family or carers. Agreement to treatment should also be sought from younger children."

Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential
It is estimated that approximately a quarter of pregnancies in Australia are unintended. When treating a female of childbearing potential who has a psychiatric disorder, consider the impact of the disorder and its treatment on a potential pregnancy. Discuss contraception with them—psychotropics cross the placenta and people taking teratogenic drugs should use effective contraception to prevent inadvertent fetal exposure.
It is preferable for a psychiatric disorder to be in remission before pregnancy because of the:
If a patient wishes to become pregnant, undertake preconception planning. Preconception planning allows for time to trial a withdrawal or change of treatment, and to formulate a relapse management plan. Preconception planning is particularly important for patients taking teratogenic drugs; however, all psychotropics cross the placenta and are excreted into breast milk (albeit to varying degrees). If a psychotropic is taken during pregnancy or while breastfeeding; the fetus or infant will be exposed to it. Consequently, treatment choice must optimise the health and safety of the patient and fetus or infant—consider and discuss:
The patient, their significant other(s) and the clinician can then plan the preferred treatment approach during the perinatal period using shared decision making.

Antidepressant use in females of childbearing potential
The effectiveness of hormonal contraception is not affected by concurrent antidepressant use; however, some hormonal contraceptives can increase the concentration of amitriptyline and imipramine and the risk of adverse effects and toxicity.
If a patient taking an antidepressant wishes to plan a pregnancy, see Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential for advice on preconception planning and Antidepressant use during pregnancy for information on antidepressant choice and adverse effects during pregnancy. If as part of the preconception plan, the decision is made to switch antidepressants, see here, or stop the antidepressant, see here.

Antiepileptic use for psychiatric disorders in females of childbearing potential
Antiepileptics recommended in these guidelines for psychiatric disorders are sodium valproate, carbamazepine, pregabalin and lamotrigine.
The data used to inform the below recommendations are taken from studies of females of childbearing potential with epilepsy; however, the risks attributed to the drugs below are expected to be similar in patients with psychiatric disorders.
Avoid sodium valproate in a female of childbearing potential because if pregnancy occurs, the risk of major malformations (including neural tube defects) is over 10% and the risk of developmental disorders, particularly lower intelligence quotient (IQ), is estimated to be between 30 and 40%. If sodium valproate is the treatment of choice, ensure the patient understands these risks and uses effective contraception. Sodium valproate has also been associated with increased rates of polycystic ovary syndrome.
Although carbamazepine has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, this risk less than with sodium valproate—advise the patient about this risk and discuss the importance of effective contraception.
Pregabalin has limited safety data in pregnancy. If pregabalin is required, ensure the patient understands there is a potential risk of harm to the fetus and discuss effective contraception.
Lamotrigine has no clear link with adverse obstetric outcomes.
For advice on hormonal contraceptive drug interactions, see here.
If a patient taking an antiepileptic wishes to plan a pregnancy:

Antipsychotic use in females of childbearing potential
Effectiveness of hormonal contraception is not reduced by concurrent antipsychotic use, but the following contraceptives increase clozapine blood concentration:
Because of the risk of toxicity associated with this interaction, use an alternative contraceptive method if a patient takes clozapine—see Overview of factors affecting contraceptive choice for contraception advice. If a patient taking clozapine starts or stops an interacting contraceptive, monitor for adverse effects or efficacy (as relevant), check clozapine concentration and consider dosage adjustment; see here for advice. For further information on drug interactions, consult a drug information resource.
Some antipsychotics increase blood prolactin concentration and reduce fertility; see Table 8.31 for the approximate relative frequency of hyperprolactinaemia with antipsychotics. Inform a patient who takes an antipsychotic that causes hyperprolactinemia that fertility may be impaired and that if the antipsychotic is stopped, the risk of pregnancy may increase.
If a patient taking an antipsychotic wishes to plan a pregnancy, see Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential for advice on preconception planning, and Antipsychotic use during pregnancy for information on antipsychotic choice and adverse effects during pregnancy. If the decision is made to stop the antipsychotic as part of the preconception plan, see Stopping an antipsychotic for advice for patients with bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders.

Benzodiazepine, zolpidem or zopiclone use in females of childbearing potential
There are no major concerns associated with benzodiazepine (eg clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam), zolpidem or zopiclone use in a female of childbearing potential, regardless of whether they are using a hormonal contraceptive.
If a patient taking a benzodiazepine, zolpidem or zopiclone wishes to plan a pregnancy, see Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential for advice on preconception planning and, as relevant, Benzodiazepine use during pregnancy or Zolpidem or zopiclone use during pregnancy. If the patient has been taking a benzodiazepine long term to treat an anxiety disorder and the decision is made to stop the drug, see here.
If the patient has been taking a benzodiazepine, zolpidem or zopiclone long term to treat insomnia, see here for advice on stopping the drug.

Lisdexamfetamine use for psychiatric disorders in females of childbearing potential
Limited data suggest there are no major concerns associated with lisdexamfetamine use in a female of childbearing potential, regardless of whether they are using a hormonal contraceptive.
If the patient wishes to plan a pregnancy, see Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential for advice on preconception planning and Lisdexamfetamine use during pregnancy.

Lithium use in females of childbearing potential
Because first-trimester lithium use is associated with an increased risk of rare cardiac malformations, discuss the importance of effective contraception with a female of childbearing potential. Lithium and hormonal contraceptives can be used concurrently.
If a patient taking lithium wishes to plan a pregnancy:

Suvorexant use in females of childbearing potential
Use suvorexant with caution in females of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. There are no human data about safety in pregnancy. Large doses of suvorexant in animal studies have impaired fetal growth. Suvorexant and contraceptives can be used concurrently.
If a patient taking suvorexant wishes to plan a pregnancy, see Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential for advice on preconception planning and Suvorexant use during pregnancy.

Complementary medicine use for psychiatric disorders in females of childbearing potential
Limited data suggest that the risk of patient or fetal harm is not increased if a patient becomes pregnant while taking omega-3 fatty acids or St John’s wort. The effectiveness of hormonal contraception is not reduced by taking omega-3 fatty acids. However, St John’s wort may reduce the blood concentration and effectiveness of some hormonal contraceptives—for further advice, see here.

For information on the following drugs during pregnancy, see:

Overview of psychotropic pregnancy data
The recommendations in these guidelines for psychotropic use during pregnancy are drawn on expert consensus based on evidence of low to moderate quality.
Although there is no reason to suspect that a psychotropic would be ineffective during pregnancy, there have been no randomised controlled trials, so the effectiveness of psychotropics in this patient group remains unproven. Although pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics alter during pregnancy, the clinical implications of these changes are relatively unknown.
Psychotropic safety data in pregnancy are limited to observational studies that have significant confounders (eg psychiatric disorder, age, weight, alcohol and nicotine use). However, safety data continues to improve as more patient data is submitted to pregnancy registries and studies more effectively control for confounders.

Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy
All psychotropics cross the placenta (albeit to varying degrees)–if a psychotropic is taken during pregnancy, the fetus will be exposed to it. Consequently, treatment choice must optimise the health and safety of the patient and fetus—consider:
Fetus
Patient
Potential harms of psychotropic use
Potential benefits of psychotropic use
There is no risk-neutral or universally applicable treatment for a pregnant patient with a psychiatric disorder; individualise treatment, based on the considerations listed above. Do not avoid using a psychotropic if it is indicated; an active psychiatric disorder during pregnancy can have a significant impact on both patient and fetus.
Avoid abruptly stopping a psychotropic upon discovering pregnancy. Ongoing treatment may be required and, even if treatment will be stopped, gradual withdrawal reduces the risk of relapse. Furthermore, stopping or switching the drug may not remove the risk of fetal harm (depending on gestational stage). If the patient is taking sodium valproate, carbamazepine or lithium, urgently decide on a treatment approach; see Sodium valproate or carbamazepine during pregnancy or Lithium use during pregnancy.
Involve the patient and, if the patient consents, their significant other(s) in treatment decisions (see also Shared decision making). Educate them about the harm–benefit profile of the relevant treatments during pregnancy and breastfeeding and provide information in consumer-friendly formats, which are available from:
The above websites also provide updated information on the use of drugs in pregnancy for clinicians.
Avoid polypharmacy and use the lowest possible dose in patients who are pregnant to reduce the risk of adverse fetal outcomes. Physiological changes during pregnancy may alter pharmacokinetics in unpredictable ways. The magnitude of these changes is usually greatest in the third trimester. Total volume of distribution and kidney clearance increases, drug protein binding reduces and cytochrome P450 enzyme activity changes; these factors may necessitate a dose alteration, depending on the patient’s presentation. If available, use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide the lowest effective dose [Note 1] [Note 2].
A fetal anatomy scan is offered to pregnant Australians at 18 to 20 weeks gestation. Encourage a patient who has taken a psychotropic during the first trimester to have this scan to check for congenital malformations.
If an infant was exposed to a psychotropic antenatally, consider the need for observation in the initial postpartum period.
For more information about drug use in pregnancy, see here.

Antidepressant use during pregnancy
If an antidepressant is required during pregnancy, consider the:
Antidepressant safety data in pregnancy are limited—selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have the largest amount of pregnancy safety data of all antidepressants.
If an antidepressant is required for the first time during pregnancy, use an SSRI other than paroxetine because of its association with cardiac malformations and miscarriage. Sertraline is most commonly used because it has the most safety data. If the patient intends to breastfeed, avoid starting fluoxetine during pregnancy because, of the SSRIs, it has the highest reported concentrations in breastmilk.
If a patient is already taking paroxetine or fluoxetine, the evidence of harm is not sufficiently strong to warrant switching to a different SSRI. Discuss the concerns so that the patient can make an informed decision about treatment—see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Although less data are available to support its use in pregnancy, venlafaxine appears to have a similar risk profile to SSRIs in terms of teratogenicity and poor neonatal adaptation. The risk of miscarriage is similar to that of paroxetine.
Very limited data suggest use of mirtazapine or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) is not associated with congenital malformations. Cases of neonatal adaptation problems have been reported.
The safety during pregnancy of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mianserin, moclobemide, phenelzine, reboxetine, tranylcypromine and vortioxetine has not been adequately studied. Only continue or start these drugs in pregnancy if the harm–benefit analysis supports it.
The association of antidepressant use with low birth weight/small-for-gestational age infants is controversial. Studies do not adequately control for depression, which has been shown to contribute to low birth weight/small-for-gestational-age infants.
If a decision is made to switch or stop the antidepressant, see Switching antidepressants or Stopping an antidepressant.
Early data suggested an increase in the risk of some rare malformations, particularly cardiac, with SSRI and SNRI exposure. However, the association has not been consistently confirmed in meta-analyses and may be explained by confounders (eg depression, increased cardiac surveillance with gestational exposure). A cautious interpretation is that gestational exposure may slightly increase the risk of cardiac malformations; paroxetine has most often been implicated. However, do not avoid using an SSRI or SNRI if indicated during pregnancy—see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.
TCAs and mirtazapine have not been associated with malformations but have not been studied to the same extent as SSRIs and SNRIs, so are not thought to be safer and should be used with caution. Agomelatine, mianserin, moclobemide, phenelzine, reboxetine, tranylcypromine and vortioxetine have not adequately studied during pregnancy; use with extreme caution.
Although some data suggest a link between all antidepressants and miscarriage and preterm birth, this association is inconsistent and subject to confounding. SSRIs and SNRIs are the antidepressants most frequently studied in pregnancy; a small but consistent association has seen between:
In patients who have risk factors for hypertension or postpartum haemorrhage, or have a history of miscarriages or preterm birth of unknown aetiology, use an antidepressant with extra caution. If an antidepressant is required, it is suggested, on limited evidence, to avoid paroxetine and venlafaxine.
Abruptly stopping clomipramine during pregnancy has been associated with premature birth and neonatal seizures.
Consider the above advice in accordance with Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.
Poor neonatal adaptation is observed in approximately 10 to 30% of neonates exposed to an SSRI in late pregnancy and has also been observed with other antidepressants. It is a syndrome resembling serotonergic overstimulation in the first few days of life. Neonatal adaptation syndrome increases the likelihood of admission to a neonatal unit and is characterised by:
Do not stop or reduce the dose of an antidepressant in the last few weeks of pregnancy with the aim of avoiding neonatal adaptation syndrome; it does not improve neonatal outcomes and increases the risk of patient relapse.
In most cases, if the infant receives supportive care, the syndrome subsides within 2 weeks.
Consider the above advice in accordance with Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN) is a rare condition affecting 1 to 2 infants per 1000 live births. It has a high rate of mortality (5%) and severe morbidity (60%). Although fetal exposure to an SSRI after 20 weeks gestation is associated with a small increase in absolute risk of this syndrome, the risk is still extremely low and does not preclude the use of SSRIs in pregnancy. The association does not appear to apply to other antidepressants, though these have been used in much smaller numbers than SSRIs, making it less likely that an association with such a rare disorder would be detectable. Advise the patient of this small increase in risk as part of the treatment decision-making process—see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.
At the time of writing, there is no conclusive evidence of a causal link between antenatal SSRI use and neurodevelopmental disorders in later life, including autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Any association is likely to be accounted for by confounders rather than gestational SSRI exposure.
Other antidepressants have not been studied for such an association.

If an antidepressant is required during pregnancy, consider the:
Antidepressant safety data in pregnancy are limited—selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have the largest amount of pregnancy safety data of all antidepressants.

Although less data are available to support its use in pregnancy, venlafaxine appears to have a similar risk profile to SSRIs in terms of teratogenicity and poor neonatal adaptation. The risk of miscarriage is similar to that of paroxetine.
Very limited data suggest use of mirtazapine or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) is not associated with congenital malformations. Cases of neonatal adaptation problems have been reported.
The safety during pregnancy of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mianserin, moclobemide, phenelzine, reboxetine, tranylcypromine and vortioxetine has not been adequately studied. Only continue or start these drugs in pregnancy if the harm–benefit analysis supports it.
The association of antidepressant use with low birth weight/small-for-gestational age infants is controversial. Studies do not adequately control for depression, which has been shown to contribute to low birth weight/small-for-gestational-age infants.
If a decision is made to switch or stop the antidepressant, see Switching antidepressants or Stopping an antidepressant.

Early data suggested an increase in the risk of some rare malformations, particularly cardiac, with SSRI and SNRI exposure. However, the association has not been consistently confirmed in meta-analyses and may be explained by confounders (eg depression, increased cardiac surveillance with gestational exposure). A cautious interpretation is that gestational exposure may slightly increase the risk of cardiac malformations; paroxetine has most often been implicated. However, do not avoid using an SSRI or SNRI if indicated during pregnancy—see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.
TCAs and mirtazapine have not been associated with malformations but have not been studied to the same extent as SSRIs and SNRIs, so are not thought to be safer and should be used with caution. Agomelatine, mianserin, moclobemide, phenelzine, reboxetine, tranylcypromine and vortioxetine have not adequately studied during pregnancy; use with extreme caution.

Although some data suggest a link between all antidepressants and miscarriage and preterm birth, this association is inconsistent and subject to confounding. SSRIs and SNRIs are the antidepressants most frequently studied in pregnancy; a small but consistent association has seen between:
In patients who have risk factors for hypertension or postpartum haemorrhage, or have a history of miscarriages or preterm birth of unknown aetiology, use an antidepressant with extra caution. If an antidepressant is required, it is suggested, on limited evidence, to avoid paroxetine and venlafaxine.
Abruptly stopping clomipramine during pregnancy has been associated with premature birth and neonatal seizures.
Consider the above advice in accordance with Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.

Poor neonatal adaptation is observed in approximately 10 to 30% of neonates exposed to an SSRI in late pregnancy and has also been observed with other antidepressants. It is a syndrome resembling serotonergic overstimulation in the first few days of life. Neonatal adaptation syndrome increases the likelihood of admission to a neonatal unit and is characterised by:
Do not stop or reduce the dose of an antidepressant in the last few weeks of pregnancy with the aim of avoiding neonatal adaptation syndrome; it does not improve neonatal outcomes and increases the risk of patient relapse.
In most cases, if the infant receives supportive care, the syndrome subsides within 2 weeks.
Consider the above advice in accordance with Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN) is a rare condition affecting 1 to 2 infants per 1000 live births. It has a high rate of mortality (5%) and severe morbidity (60%). Although fetal exposure to an SSRI after 20 weeks gestation is associated with a small increase in absolute risk of this syndrome, the risk is still extremely low and does not preclude the use of SSRIs in pregnancy. The association does not appear to apply to other antidepressants, though these have been used in much smaller numbers than SSRIs, making it less likely that an association with such a rare disorder would be detectable. Advise the patient of this small increase in risk as part of the treatment decision-making process—see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Considerations for antidepressant use in pregnancy.

At the time of writing, there is no conclusive evidence of a causal link between antenatal SSRI use and neurodevelopmental disorders in later life, including autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Any association is likely to be accounted for by confounders rather than gestational SSRI exposure.
Other antidepressants have not been studied for such an association.

Antipsychotic use during pregnancy
Antipsychotic use during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Avoid switching antipsychotics during pregnancy because it increases the risk of fetal adverse effects from exposure to multiple drugs and relapse of the psychiatric disorder.
If treating a new-onset disorder during pregnancy, seek expert advice. It is preferable to use an antipsychotic with the most safety data and highest ranking for the relevant disorder (eg bipolar disorder, psychoses). Clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone have the most safety data. Fewer data are available for amisulpride, aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, periciazine, ziprasidone and zuclopenthixol; there are no published data for asenapine, brexpiprazole, lurasidone and paliperidone during pregnancy. The malformation rate from the antipsychotics described above is only marginally elevated above the background rate and this may be due to psychiatric disorder, not the drug. The risk of pregnancy complications does not appear to be increased with antipsychotics. However, depending on the adverse effect profile of the drug, monitor the patient for gestational diabetes. Poor neonatal adaptation has only been described in case reports.
Continue long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulations during pregnancy, although there are minimal pregnancy data to guide their use. Mental health stability is crucial to the wellbeing of the patient and the fetus.
The few studies addressing the long-term developmental effects of in utero exposure to antipsychotics have found no difference between exposed infants and controls.

Benzodiazepine use during pregnancy
Benzodiazepine use during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Although data are limited, benzodiazepines are generally considered safe in pregnancy except in the third trimester, when they should be used with caution, under expert advice. Benzodiazepine use in the third trimester, especially those with a long half-life (eg diazepam, clonazepam) can cause poor neonatal adaptation, neonatal drowsiness, respiratory depression, poor temperature regulation, poor feeding and hypotonicity (‘floppy infant syndrome’). If a benzodiazepine must be used, if possible, use one with a shorter half-life (eg temazepam, lorazepam).
Although benzodiazepines have been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age infants, other confounders (eg severe mental health disorders, problem drug use) may have contributed to this risk. Earlier associations with fetal cleft lip or palate are not substantiated by prospective studies.
If the patient has been taking a benzodiazepine long term to treat insomnia, see here for advice on stopping the drug.
If the patient has been taking a benzodiazepine long term to treat an anxiety disorder and the decision is made to stop the drug, see here.

Lamotrigine for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy
Lamotrigine monotherapy is not associated with increased risk of congenital abnormalities or adverse pregnancy outcomes but data are limited—also consider Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Lamotrigine clearance can increase by up to 50% in late pregnancy—a dose increase, with a corresponding dose reduction after delivery, is often required—see here for further information.

Lisdexamfetamine use for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy
Lisdexamfetamine use for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
There is a lack of adequate pregnancy safety data for lisdexamfetamine; however, findings for dexamfetamine (its metabolite) may cautiously be applied. Most population-based studies indicate that dexamfetamine is not associated with congenital malformations and it may be used with caution in pregnancy.

Lithium use during pregnancy
Ideally, the management of a patient taking lithium during the perinatal period should be multidisciplinary, with liaison between the general practitioner, psychiatrist, obstetric team and paediatrician. The patient should have a clear childbirth plan that is shared with the multidisciplinary team. If possible, delivery should take place in a tertiary hospital with a specialist neonatal care unit and psychiatric team; alternatively, seek advice from the patient’s psychiatrist and a paediatrician.
Lithium use during the first trimester has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations (eg Ebstein anomaly); however, the absolute risk of malformations appears low. Although limited data suggest that lithium does not increase complications at the time of delivery or affect long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, increased rates of neonatal complications have been reported.
If a patient becomes pregnant while taking lithium, do not abruptly stop it; urgently seek advice from a psychiatrist to help decide upon the approach—see here for guiding principles. Abruptly stopping lithium dramatically increases the risk of relapse in bipolar disorder and in turn fetal harm; for advice on managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy, see here.
Breastfeeding while taking lithium is not recommended; this may influence the decision to continue lithium—see also Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding. If the decision is made to switch to another drug, it is preferable to switch well before birth is expected; if lithium is used for bipolar disorder, see Considerations in managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy for guidance. If lithium was stopped because of teratogenicity concerns, it can be restarted in the second trimester. If a patient has taken lithium while pregnant, encourage them to have a high-resolution ultrasound and fetal echocardiography at 18 to 20 weeks to detect cardiac malformation.
If the decision is made to continue or restart lithium during pregnancy, see Box 8.45 for the management approach.
Remind the patient of signs of lithium toxicity and the importance of maintaining adequate hydration.
Check kidney function and blood lithium concentration every 4 weeks during pregnancy until 34 weeks gestation, and weekly thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring if hyperemesis gravidarum or nausea and vomiting are problematic.
Check thyroid function at 12, 24, 36 and 40 weeks gestation.
Encourage the patient to have a high-resolution ultrasound and fetal echocardiography at 18 to 20 weeks to detect cardiac malformation.
At admission to hospital for delivery:
If intrapartum complications (eg haemodynamic instability) occur, check intrapartum blood lithium concentration.
Immediately after delivery:

Melatonin use during pregnancy
Melatonin use during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Avoid using melatonin in pregnancy; safety data in humans is lacking. Endogenous melatonin is known to cross the placenta, and is thought to play a role in the development of the fetus’ circadian rhythm. Results from animal studies are mixed, with some indicating reduced birth weight and prolonged gestation.

Pregabalin use for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy
Pregabalin use for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Avoid using pregabalin in pregnancy; safety data in humans is lacking.

Sodium valproate or carbamazepine for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy
Fetal exposure to sodium valproate is associated with a high risk of major congenital malformations (neural tube defects have an incidence of 11% in some studies) and neurodevelopmental disorders (30 to 40% estimated incidence). Do not use sodium valproate in pregnancy for a psychiatric disorder unless other treatment options (eg electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]) cannot be used and there is a high risk of harm if sodium valproate is stopped (eg relapse to a disabled or suicidal state).
The risk of major congenital malformations associated with antenatal carbamazepine use is of lesser magnitude, but still concerning. The risks with carbamazepine appear to be limited to the first trimester—it may be used from the second trimester.
If a patient taking sodium valproate or carbamazepine becomes pregnant, discuss the risk of fetal malformations and alternative therapies; see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and, if relevant, Considerations in managing bipolar disorder during pregnancy for treatment guidance.
Neural tube defects can usually be detected with routine screening at 13 weeks gestation. A fetal anatomy scan is also offered at 18 to 20 weeks. Encourage a patient who has taken either anticonvulsant in the first trimester to have these tests—refer her to an obstetric service that offers screens for major congenital malformations (eg alpha-fetoprotein measurement, ultrasound examination, fetal echocardiography).
Limited data suggest that high-dose folic acid may reduce the risk of major congenital malformations and is not associated with adverse effects. For patients taking sodium valproate or carbamazepine who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant, use:
If stopping either drug or switching to an alternative drug, seek psychiatric advice and review the patient’s mental state every 1 to 2 weeks for the next 4 to 8 weeks for signs of relapse. Ideally, obtain perinatal psychiatrist opinion at least once during the pregnancy.
Vitamin K supplementation during pregnancy is no longer routinely recommended to reduce the risk of haemorrhage in neonates with gestational exposure to enzyme-inducing antiepileptics (eg carbamazepine); instead, ensure the neonate receives intramuscular vitamin K immediately after birth.

Suvorexant use during pregnancy
Suvorexant use during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Avoid suvorexant during pregnancy; safety data in humans is lacking. In animal studies, large doses have been associated with impaired fetal growth.

Zolpidem or zopiclone use during pregnancy
Zolpidem or zopiclone use during pregnancy should be guided by the considerations outlined in Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy.
Use zolpidem or zopiclone with caution in pregnancy; there are limited safety data. The antenatal use of either drug has been associated with small-for-gestational age and low birth weight neonates. Zolpidem may also increase the risk of preterm or caesarean delivery. Increased rates of congenital malformations have not been reported.
If the patient has been taking zolpidem or zopiclone long term to treat insomnia, see here for advice on stopping the drug.

Complementary medicine use for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy
There are no reports of congenital malformations occurring with omega-3 fatty acids use during pregnancy, though studies with large sample sizes have not been performed. It is preferable to encourage patients to include fatty fish in their diet (avoiding those with high mercury concentration [Note 3]), or foods rich in flaxseed oil, in order to obtain the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.
Limited evidence suggests that there is no increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of St John’s wort during pregnancy. However, it is preferable to use an antidepressant with more efficacy and pregnancy safety data (eg a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI)]); see Antidepressants use during pregnancy.
Consider advice for use of complementary medicines in pregnancy in accordance with Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy."
recovery-relapse-prevention-psychoses,"Principles of recovery and relapse prevention in psychoses including schizophrenia
Although most people who have a psychotic episode return to a productive life, this process is complex and multifaceted; antipsychotic therapy is an important component of recovery. Continuous therapy with the antipsychotic the patient best tolerates is also the most effective way to reduce relapse and prevent suicide. See Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia for the approach to facilitating recovery, preventing relapse and suicide, and improving quality of life and overall health.
The treatment advice in this topic applies to adults and young people; antipsychotic therapy for recovery and relapse prevention in children follows the same principles but should be guided by a child psychiatrist or an age-appropriate mental health service.
Continue antipsychotic therapy (with monitoring for adverse effects) for an adequate duration after a psychotic episode. For duration of antipsychotic therapy after a first episode of psychosis, see here. Longer-term treatment is required if relapse occurs—seek psychiatric advice.
Do not use intermittent therapy (‘drug holidays’) during treatment, because restarting an antipsychotic early in relapse is not as effective as continuous therapy.
Most patients who recover from a first episode of psychosis experience a relapse. Relapse is usually associated with poor adherence or stopping antipsychotic therapy as part of the treatment plan—see Box 8.41 for other contributors to relapse.
If a patient is poorly adherent to oral antipsychotic therapy, address this with psychosocial interventions and by monitoring for and addressing adverse effects—see also Adherence to psychotropics. If this is ineffective, switch to a long-acting injectable formulation to improve adherence [Note 1]. If the patient does not consent to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic and their poor adherence is associated with worsening symptoms, involuntary community treatment may be necessary [Note 2].
Advantages and disadvantages of long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulations are detailed in Table 8.21. Patients with multiple, severe relapses, comorbid problem substance use or cognitive impairment are most likely to benefit from a long-acting injectable formulation.
Advantages
Disadvantages
improved adherence
less frequent administration
regular contact between the patient and their mental healthcare team; the team will be aware if the patient has not taken their antipsychotic
reduced risk of overdose
more predictable relationship between dosage and resultant blood concentration (if administered correctly)
reduced variability in peak–trough blood concentrations
pain and irritation at injection site
less flexible and slower dosage adjustment—depending on pharmacokinetics, take weeks to months to reach steady-state concentration, making treatment response difficult to assess during this time
adverse effects can persist for a significant time, even after the antipsychotic has been stopped
if given involuntarily, negative relationship with mental health team
If a patient is stabilised on and adherent to an oral antipsychotic, to minimise the risk of adverse effects, slowly reduce to the lowest effective dose; see Box 8.42 for approach. Also offer the option of switching to a long-acting injectable formulation, but do not insist upon switching if the patient is tolerating their oral antipsychotic.
Up to 40% of patients with schizophrenia experience residual symptoms even when clinically stable and adherent with optimal antipsychotic therapy—see Treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Choice of long-acting injectable antipsychotic for recovery and relapse prevention in adults and young people
When starting a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, it is preferable to use an antipsychotic that the patient has tolerated in oral form and, ideally, has responded to and is stabilised on (ie taken for at least 2 weeks). This:
If the patient takes an oral antipsychotic not available as a long-acting injectable formulation, to establish tolerability, first switch to an oral antipsychotic that is available as a long-acting injectable formulation (see Table 8.22). There is limited head-to-head evidence to guide long-acting injectable antipsychotic choice—consider adverse effect profiles.
Olanzapine is second-line therapy because it causes significant cardiometabolic adverse effects, and the long-acting injectable formulation rarely causes a postinjection syndrome with signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose. If using the long-acting injectable formulation of olanzapine monitor for signs of sedation every 30 minutes for at least 2 hours after the injection, or until the patient is alert and oriented and free from signs or symptoms of overdose.
When offering a long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulation, if possible, discuss the following with the patient and, if the patient consents, their family, carers or significant others:
For additional considerations in antipsychotic choice, see:

Long-acting injectable antipsychotic regimens for recovery and relapse prevention in adults and young people
If possible, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic should be started in consultation with the patient’s psychiatrist or mental health team, and managed by a practitioner experienced in their use. For advice on choice of long-acting injectable antipsychotic for adults and young people, see here.
Consult a drug information source for advice on contraindications, precautions and administration. To ensure safety and efficacy, follow the instructions in the product information—inadvertent injection into subcutaneous fat can result in highly variable blood concentrations and toxicity.
Data on long-acting injectable antipsychotic use in young people are limited because young people are poorly represented in clinical trials.
For duration of antipsychotic therapy after a first episode of psychosis, see here. Longer-term treatment is required if relapse occurs—seek psychiatric advice.
If using a long-acting injectable antipsychotic for psychoses including schizophrenia, use:

Modification of long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy for recovery and relapse prevention in adults and young people
Long-acting injectable antipsychotics take weeks to months to reach steady-state concentration, depending on the half-life of the drug and the formulation; check a drug information resource for detail. Dosage adjustments should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for adverse effects). Avoid dosage adjustments before steady state has been reached; this increases the risk of adverse effects (when dosage is increased) or compromised symptom control (when dosage is reduced). Once steady state is reached, antipsychotic blood concentration monitoring may assist dosage adjustment [Note 9] [Note 10].
Breakthrough psychotic symptoms occur in up to 30% of patients treated with a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, most commonly in the first year of the disorder. Treat breakthrough symptoms by adding an oral dose of the long-acting injectable antipsychotic (if possible), and, if steady state has been reached, simultaneously increasing the long-acting injectable dose. Reduce the oral supplementation dose over weeks to months while steady state of the long-acting injectable antipsychotic is reached. The combined oral dose and long-acting injectable dose should not exceed the maximum dose of the drug.
Breakthrough psychotic symptoms can progress to a full relapse."
relapse-psychoses,"Assessing relapse in psychoses including schizophrenia in adults and young people
Most patients who recover from a first episode of psychosis experience a relapse. Relapse is usually associated with poor adherence or stopping antipsychotic therapy as part of the treatment plan.
If an apparent relapse occurs, assess the patient to determine the cause(s). Consider potential contributors to relapse. Exclude other diagnoses (see examples in Box 8.38); assess for delirium because it is an often overlooked cause of apparent relapse. Consider whether the patient was comprehensively assessed at the time of the first episode of psychosis or a previous relapse, and whether additional investigations should be undertaken (eg tests for autoimmune psychosis)—see Box 8.39.
Take the opportunity to screen the patient for adverse effects of antipsychotic therapy—perform and document the investigations listed here.

Treating relapse in psychoses including schizophrenia in adults and young people
Ideally, a relapse should be managed by the patient’s psychiatrist or mental health team, or an experienced practitioner in consultation with the team.
Evaluate whether admission to hospital is needed [Note 1]. Considerations include:
Treatment of a relapse must be multifaceted and individualised (see Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia). Start treatment as soon as possible to improve outcomes. Continued antipsychotic therapy is a key component of treatment to facilitate recovery and prevent suicide.
The choice of antipsychotic therapy for relapse depends on the cause(s) (see Assessing relapse in psychoses including schizophrenia in adults and young people) and the patient’s history.
If relapse occurs after a planned antipsychotic discontinuation, restart the previously effective antipsychotic, aiming for the previously effective dosage.
If relapse occurs after a planned antipsychotic dose reduction, increase to the previously effective dosage.
If nonadherence is the likely cause of the relapse:
If a partial response to oral antipsychotic therapy is the likely cause of the relapse, either increase to the maximum tolerated dose (see regimens here) or switch to an oral antipsychotic with a different dopaminergic receptor occupancy profile (for which adverse effect profile is a surrogate)—see Switching antipsychotics and Antipsychotic regimens for a first episode of psychosis. Doses of oral antipsychotics at the upper end of the recommended therapeutic range are often required to treat relapse.
If relapse occurs while the patient is taking a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, consider temporarily adding an oral antipsychotic until the long-acting injectable antipsychotic reaches a therapeutic concentration—see Modification of long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy.
If relapse is associated with depression or mania, see Schizoaffective disorder.
If interim treatment is required for acute agitation, see here. If the patient has trouble sleeping, see Insomnia in adults for advice on whether short-term pharmacotherapy is indicated.
Seek psychiatric advice for duration of therapy after relapse. Lifelong antipsychotic therapy is required for most people with schizophrenia.

Assessing and treating relapse in psychoses including schizophrenia in children
Urgently refer children who have apparent relapse, accompanied by their family, carers or significant others to a specialist centre (eg Headspace for children 12 years or older) or, if a specialist centre is not available, a child psychiatrist or age-appropriate mental health team. Early treatment improves outcomes."
schizoaffective-disorder,"Schizoaffective disorder
Schizoaffective disorder is often diagnosed in patients with features of both schizophrenia, and bipolar depression or severe major depression during the majority of their disorder; however, the diagnosis is controversial.
The already very limited evidence base to guide treatment of schizoaffective disorder has been further undermined by changes in the diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, the principles of treating schizoaffective disorder are the same as the Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia and the relevant mood disorder (see Principles of managing bipolar depression in adults and young people or Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people). Drug therapy should be overseen by a psychiatrist. A pragmatic approach often taken by psychiatrists is to combine an antipsychotic (either oral or a long-acting injectable) with a different class of psychotropic as appropriate for the relevant mood disorder (see Bipolar disorder or Major depression).
See also the advice on:"
schizophrenia,"Overview of schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder in which positive, negative and cognitive signs and symptoms of psychosis persist for at least 6 months and are accompanied by social and functional decline.
Schizophrenia is the most common psychotic disorder in Australia. It usually arises between late adolescence and 30 years of age and is more prevalent in males than females.
If a first episode of schizophrenia is suspected, for assessment advice, see here for adults and young people and here for children. If relapse is suspected, for assessment advice, see here for adults and young people and here for children.

Treating schizophrenia
Treatment of schizophrenia is long term and multifaceted; see Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia for advice. These guidelines provide advice on:

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia
Up to 40% of patients with schizophrenia experience residual symptoms even when clinically stable and adherent with optimal antipsychotic therapy. If residual symptoms are experienced, look for reasons for treatment resistance—see Box 8.41.
A patient is considered to have treatment-resistant schizophrenia if they meet all the following criteria [Note 1]:
If a patient has treatment-resistant schizophrenia, refer to a psychiatrist for review; clozapine may be indicated. If a patient has persistent negative symptoms, see here for targeted treatment.
It is rarely appropriate to increase the antipsychotic dose above the recommended maximum dose to try to overcome treatment resistance. Dosing above the recommended range is associated with increased adverse effects but rarely improves symptoms. In some cases, a psychiatrist may exceed the recommended maximum dose range (eg if drug metabolism is increased by patient pharmacogenetics or drug interactions).
Although individual studies support adding various drugs (eg minocycline, estrogen, N-acetylcysteine) to antipsychotic therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, this evidence is limited—no specific combination can be recommended except for patients with clozapine-resistant schizophrenia.

Clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia in adults and young people
Clozapine is the most effective therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia; at least one-third of patients moderately improve after taking clozapine for 6 to 12 months. Clozapine is uniquely effective in reducing suicidality, aggression and problem substance use.
The principal factors limiting clozapine use are its adverse effect profile and patient willingness to take an orally administered drug and adhere with regular monitoring.
A psychiatrist should offer clozapine to an adult or young person if they meet the criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and clozapine is not contraindicated.
The role and use of clozapine in children are beyond the scope of these guidelines.
Clozapine can only be started by a psychiatrist, after comprehensive assessment to determine if clozapine is suitable. This includes:
For additional considerations in clozapine use, see:
If clozapine is started for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, a typical regimen used by psychiatrists is:
Close monitoring of temperature, blood pressure, and heart and respiratory rate is required after starting clozapine; for comprehensive advice, refer to protocols available from clozapine manufacturers [Note 4] or the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care National Inpatient Medication Chart.

If clozapine therapy is interrupted for more than 48 hours, it must be restarted from 12.5 mg (see Table 8.23) to avoid severe sedation and respiratory depression.
All patients, prescribers and pharmacies must be registered with the clozapine monitoring database for the brand of clozapine used [Note 4]. These databases collect data on white cell and neutrophil count, clozapine dispensing and dosage, and past adverse events. If white cell and neutrophil counts and infection screening have not occurred, clozapine cannot be dispensed. The brand of clozapine cannot be changed without changing registration to the appropriate database to maintain continuity of monitoring data.
After 18 weeks of therapy, provided the patient and clozapine dose are stable, an authorised medical practitioner under the supervision of a psychiatrist can prescribe clozapine but cannot adjust the dosage.
Clozapine is associated with significant adverse effects, including:
It is crucial to monitor for, prevent and address these adverse effects. For advice on monitoring, preventing and managing the adverse effects listed in Table 8.31, see Antipsychotic adverse effects. In addition, monitor for, prevent and manage clozapine-specific adverse effects, as follows:
Measure the trough clozapine blood concentration (using a sample taken early in the morning) when steady state has been reached (ie the patient has been on the same dose for at least 1 week) then every 6 months. Additional monitoring is required if the patient:
Clozapine blood concentrations should be taken weekly after a change in smoking status, caffeine intake or interacting drugs. If dosage adjustment is required, it should be guided by the psychiatrist to achieve the target concentration (usually between 200 to 550 micrograms/L, but up to 1000 micrograms/L for patients who do not respond). Rapid dose increases, doses more than 600 mg daily and a clozapine blood concentration more than 600 micrograms/L are associated with a higher incidence of seizures.
Infection can significantly increase clozapine blood concentrations, which can suppress white cell counts and make infection difficult to recognise. If a patient displays signs of clozapine toxicity (eg sedation, confusion, myoclonus), measure CRP, and white cell and neutrophil counts to assess for infection.

Clozapine is the most effective therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia; at least one-third of patients moderately improve after taking clozapine for 6 to 12 months. Clozapine is uniquely effective in reducing suicidality, aggression and problem substance use.
The principal factors limiting clozapine use are its adverse effect profile and patient willingness to take an orally administered drug and adhere with regular monitoring.
A psychiatrist should offer clozapine to an adult or young person if they meet the criteria for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and clozapine is not contraindicated.

If clozapine therapy is interrupted for more than 48 hours, it must be restarted from 12.5 mg (see Table 8.23) to avoid severe sedation and respiratory depression.
All patients, prescribers and pharmacies must be registered with the clozapine monitoring database for the brand of clozapine used [Note 4]. These databases collect data on white cell and neutrophil count, clozapine dispensing and dosage, and past adverse events. If white cell and neutrophil counts and infection screening have not occurred, clozapine cannot be dispensed. The brand of clozapine cannot be changed without changing registration to the appropriate database to maintain continuity of monitoring data.
After 18 weeks of therapy, provided the patient and clozapine dose are stable, an authorised medical practitioner under the supervision of a psychiatrist can prescribe clozapine but cannot adjust the dosage.

Clozapine is associated with significant adverse effects, including:
It is crucial to monitor for, prevent and address these adverse effects. For advice on monitoring, preventing and managing the adverse effects listed in Table 8.31, see Antipsychotic adverse effects. In addition, monitor for, prevent and manage clozapine-specific adverse effects, as follows:
Measure the trough clozapine blood concentration (using a sample taken early in the morning) when steady state has been reached (ie the patient has been on the same dose for at least 1 week) then every 6 months. Additional monitoring is required if the patient:
Clozapine blood concentrations should be taken weekly after a change in smoking status, caffeine intake or interacting drugs. If dosage adjustment is required, it should be guided by the psychiatrist to achieve the target concentration (usually between 200 to 550 micrograms/L, but up to 1000 micrograms/L for patients who do not respond). Rapid dose increases, doses more than 600 mg daily and a clozapine blood concentration more than 600 micrograms/L are associated with a higher incidence of seizures.
Infection can significantly increase clozapine blood concentrations, which can suppress white cell counts and make infection difficult to recognise. If a patient displays signs of clozapine toxicity (eg sedation, confusion, myoclonus), measure CRP, and white cell and neutrophil counts to assess for infection.

Clozapine-resistant schizophrenia
Between 30 and 70% of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia do not respond to clozapine and require further treatment—refer to the psychiatrist overseeing clozapine therapy. Options include combining clozapine with:"
seasonal-affective-disorder,"Seasonal affective disorder
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), often referred to as the ‘winter blues’, is a seasonal pattern of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years. Symptoms occur and completely resolve during particular times of the year and are not related to any other psychosocial stressors (eg seasonal unemployment).
Consider differential diagnoses in patients presenting with depressive symptoms. Thoroughly assess patients with depressive symptoms, including an assessment of suicide risk.
The principles of diagnosis and treatment of seasonal affective disorder are the same as for major depression; however:"
separation-anxiety-disorder,"Overview of separation anxiety disorder
Separation anxiety disorder is characterised by excessive and developmentally inappropriate anxiety related to being away from home or separated from significant attachment figures. Anxiety can also be experienced when there is a threat of these events. The fear and anxiety that the person experiences is persistent, and leads to avoidance of separation. At the time of separation, anxiety may reach the point of panic. The disorder is associated with clinically significant distress, or impairment in social, academic or other important areas of functioning. Separation anxiety disorder was previously only recognised in children with at least 1 month of symptoms, but is now also recognised in adults and young people with at least 6 months of symptoms. It remains an uncommon diagnosis in adulthood—most patients have comorbid major depression or another anxiety disorder.
Children with separation anxiety disorder often fear that a disaster will prevent them reuniting with their parents. This leads to persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home, or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure. Nightmares with themes of separation are common. The child may refuse to go to school or have somatic symptoms (eg headache, abdominal pain) related to school attendance. It is thought that separation anxiety disorder in childhood is associated with panic disorder or agoraphobia in adulthood.
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as separation anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners see, here.
For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.

Psychosocial interventions for separation anxiety disorder
At the time of diagnosis, provide psychoeducation to the patient and, if relevant, their family, carers or significant others. Effective treatment requires an understanding of the patient’s psychosocial environment. Family therapy and attachment-theory informed psychotherapies are commonly used. Children with mild separation anxiety usually respond to family interventions and behavioural interventions.

Pharmacotherapy for separation anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Psychosocial interventions are first line for the management of separation anxiety disorder in adults and young people.
There is no specific pharmacotherapy for separation anxiety disorder in adults and young people. Base treatment decisions on the patient’s psychiatric comorbidities—most patients have comorbid major depression or another anxiety disorder.

Pharmacotherapy for separation anxiety disorder in children
Psychosocial interventions are first line for separation anxiety disorder in children.
If a child with separation anxiety disorder has severe symptoms, consider pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children (eg child psychiatrist, paediatrician). If a drug is required, use this concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line drugs; however, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events.
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for separation anxiety in children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for separation anxiety disorder, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children, whereas the maximum doses approximate those used in adults and young people. In children 12 years and older, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for separation anxiety disorder, use:

Follow-up and duration of pharmacotherapy for separation anxiety disorder
Throughout antidepressant therapy, regularly review treatment response and monitor for adverse effects. Monitor patients more frequently at the start of treatment because activation and suicidal thoughts are more common during the first 7 to 10 days.
Assess response to antidepressant treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.6). Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 to 2 weeks; full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].

Nonresponse to pharmacotherapy for separation anxiety disorder in children
Refer children with separation anxiety disorder to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input, if their symptoms persist despite:"
sleep-disturbance-shift-workers,"Assessing sleep–wake disturbances in shift workers
Nightshift workers can experience reduced sleep quality and quantity, resulting in sleepiness and impaired alertness and performance during their shift. This can have health and safety implications and worsen quality of life.
The effect of shift work on a person’s sleep–wake cycle varies—it depends on their:
Nonwork commitments (eg caregiving duties) can further reduce opportunities to sleep, compounding the problem.
Impairment associated with sleep disturbance may not always be evident in a shift worker—strategies to reduce the risk of harm associated with these impairments should be undertaken (eg include extra checks when performing critical tasks, avoid driving home if possible).
If a nightshift worker has excessive sleepiness during shifts and trouble sleeping between shifts:

Interventions to prevent and treat sleep–wake disturbances in shift workers
The evidence for interventions to prevent and treat sleep–wake disturbances in shift workers is limited. Despite this, the behavioural interventions in Box 8.36 are recommended because they may be effective and are unlikely to cause harm. These interventions aim to:
Individualise the interventions in Box 8.36; consider the person’s sleep requirements, chronotype, nature of work (frequency and timing of shifts, opportunities to rest during or between shifts) and nonwork commitments.
Box 8.36 can be printed as a handout.
To reduce the risk of harm associated with sleepiness and impaired cognition, also recommend strategies to improve safety (eg extra checks when performing critical tasks, avoid driving home if possible).
Before starting nightshift:
During nightshift:
Between shifts in a series of nightshifts:
Recovering once the cycle of shift work is over:
The treatment of sleep–wake disturbances in shift workers is primarily behavioural; however, limited evidence suggests immediate-release melatonin may help:
Immediate-release melatonin is not registered in Australia, but is available via the Special Access Scheme and from compounding pharmacies. A reasonable regimen for shift work–related sleep–wake disturbance is:
Avoid over-the-counter and internet-sourced melatonin formulations because the melatonin content in these preparations is unreliable. If a suitable immediate-release formulation of melatonin is not available, the modified-release formulation, which is registered in Australia for insomnia in adults aged 55 years or older, may be considered; however, it does not have evidence to support its use or to guide administration time for shift work–related sleep–wake disturbance.
If, despite the use of the interventions above, a person continues to experience daytime insomnia during the shift-work cycle, excessive sleepiness during shifts or significant distress, seek advice from a sleep physician—treatment options include drugs to promote alertness (eg modafinil and armodafinil). It may be preferable to avoid working nightshifts.
Although hypnotics are commonly used to treat daytime insomnia in shift-workers, there is a lack of evidence to support this practice and hypnotics have adverse effects including sedation (which may persist at work) and dependence—see Hypnotics for further detail.

Behavioural sleep problems are common in children and adolescents—see the Australian Sleep Association website for assessment and treatment advice.
Other causes of sleep problems in childhood and adolescence include:
If a child or adolescent has difficulty sleeping, first-line therapy is good sleep hygiene; see the Raising Children website for advice.
If a child or adolescent does not respond to treatment, seek specialist advice (eg paediatrician, sleep specialist, child psychiatrist).
Although melatonin is widely used for sleep problems in children and adolescents, high-quality evidence of benefit and long-term safety data are lacking. There is also little evidence to guide dosing, choice of formulation and timing of administration. Melatonin should only be used for sleep problems in children and adolescents with specialist advice (eg paediatrician, sleep specialist, child psychiatrist)."
social-anxiety-disorder,"Overview of social anxiety disorder
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is associated with a persistent, excessive fear or anxiety of social situations in which the person may be exposed to the scrutiny of others. The fear may be experienced in one or more social situations, including performing in front of others (eg speaking in public), social interactions and being observed (eg eating or drinking in public). The person anticipates that they will be negatively evaluated by others, and fears that they may say something or act in a way that is humiliating or embarrassing. The phobic situations are avoided, or endured with intense anxiety or distress. Unlike common, transient social fears, fear or anxiety in social anxiety disorder is recurrent and lasts for at least 6 months.
If a person experiences social anxiety in discrete performance situations only (eg public speaking) and does not avoid other social situations, they are considered to have performance anxiety rather than social anxiety disorder.
The disorder often begins in childhood. Anxiety in children can manifest as tantrums, shyness at school, crying, clinging or immobility, and may lead to significant impairment in social and academic functioning. For a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder in children, anxiety must be identified in both peer settings and during encounters with adults.
Comorbid problem drug and alcohol use and major depression are common. Assess patients for these comorbidities and implement treatment.
For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety and associated disorders.

Approach to managing social anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Psychosocial interventions are first line for social anxiety disorder in adults and young people. Use pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to psychotherapy, or as an alternative if psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred.
When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Approach to managing social anxiety disorder in children
Psychosocial interventions (eg cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) are first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder in children. Children with social anxiety disorder rarely require pharmacotherapy but it may be used if psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, or if symptoms are severe. Pharmacotherapy is also recommended for children with comorbid depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use it concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.

Psychosocial interventions for social anxiety disorder
At the time of diagnosis, provide psychoeducation to the patient and, if relevant, their family, carers or significant others.
The treatment of choice in adults and young people is cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT] that incorporates both cognitive reframing (to address fears of evaluation by others) and exposure to feared situations. Where social skills deficits are suspected, social skills training may also be beneficial. There is limited evidence for acceptance and commitment therapy, interpersonal therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction and psychodynamic psychotherapy.
CBT is first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder in children. Individual, group or internet-based methods are effective and can be used.

Initial pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Follow the approach to managing social anxiety disorder in adults and young people.
Treat social anxiety disorder in adults and young people with psychosocial interventions. Consider pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to psychotherapy, or as an alternative if psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred.
If an antidepressant is indicated for social anxiety disorder, initial choice should be informed by:
SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) are first-line drugs for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. The serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine) are effective for social anxiety disorder but there is less evidence for their use than for SSRIs.
If an SSRI or SNRI is considered appropriate for social anxiety disorder, individualise the choice of drug (see above). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Use:

Initial pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in children
Follow the approach to managing social anxiety disorder in children. Psychosocial interventions are first line. If psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, or if symptoms are severe and causing significant impairment, consider pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use it concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline) are first-line drugs for social anxiety disorder in children. Although there are more data for older SSRIs, all SSRIs are likely to have similar effectiveness. Paroxetine, however, is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events.
There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.
Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.
Do not use pharmacotherapy for children 6 years or younger.
In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for social anxiety disorder, use:
When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults).

Assess response to antidepressant treatment after 2 to 4 weeks (see Figure 8.7). Response to treatment usually becomes apparent after at least 1 to 2 weeks; full benefit may take 4 to 6 weeks or longer.
Consider the following questions if a patient does not respond to an antidepressant [NB1].

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in adults and young people
Consider modifying treatment for social anxiety disorder in an adult or young person if symptoms persist despite:
Options for treatment modification include:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.
There is some evidence for clonazepam in social anxiety disorder. However, benzodiazepines should not be used as first-line pharmacotherapy because of potential harms (including increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence). These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use (particularly problem alcohol use); in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits.
Benzodiazepine use is usually restricted to acute crises and short-term initial therapy. In treatment resistance, they may be considered for maintenance therapy, ideally in consultation with a psychiatrist. Follow the principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders.
If a benzodiazepine is considered appropriate for social anxiety disorder, a suitable regimen in adults and young people is:
Psychiatrists may use phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor [MAOI]) for treatment-resistant social anxiety disorder. Although phenelzine has strong evidence of efficacy for social anxiety disorder, dietary restrictions hinder its usefulness (see Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]). Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. If phenelzine is considered appropriate for social anxiety disorder, a suitable regimen in adults and young people is:
If symptoms recur when reducing the dose or stopping therapy, patients may need ongoing pharmacotherapy.

Nonresponse to initial pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder in children
Refer children with social anxiety disorder to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input, if their symptoms persist despite:

Performance anxiety
Performance anxiety is similar to social anxiety disorder, but the social anxiety is restricted to discrete performance situations (such as a public performance). Psychosocial interventions (eg cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT] including an exposure component) are essential, and should be used as first-line treatment.
Propranolol has a limited role in performance anxiety; toxicity in overdose must be considered. Although propranolol does not relieve anxiety itself, it may reduce distressing physiological symptoms associated with anxiety (tremor, palpitations and sweating). To assess tolerability, advise the patient to take a trial dose at home before taking a dose in a performance situation.
If propranolol is considered appropriate for performance anxiety in adults and young people, use:
For children older than 12 years with extreme performance anxiety that limits their capacity to function, consider using:
Evidence is insufficient to support the use of propranolol for performance anxiety in children 12 years or younger."
specific-phobia,"Specific phobias in adults and young people
A specific phobia is an extreme fear or anxiety over actual or anticipated exposure to a specific situation or object. Specific phobias are divided into 5 subgroups:
For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.
At the time of diagnosis, provide psychoeducation to the patient. Use psychological therapies (including behavioural therapy with a graded exposure component) as first-line treatment of a specific phobia. Exposure therapy (which may include relaxation strategies) is used to gradually reduce autonomic responses to feared stimuli. Virtual-reality exposure is emerging as a convenient approach, but it is not clear if it is superior to real-world exposure.
If a specific phobia needs to be managed for a particular event or at a particular time, or if psychosocial interventions alone are insufficient, consider adjunctive use of diazepam. Short-term use of diazepam can alleviate fear and anxiety, until the patient can achieve some control of the phobia using other methods. A common example is the need to manage a phobia of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) in a patient who requires a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination; in this situation, give a single dose of diazepam before the examination.
However, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence. These risks are of particular concern in older people, in whom harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits (see Principles for the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders).
If a benzodiazepine is considered appropriate for a specific phobia, use:
For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.
For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as a specific phobia during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.

Specific phobias in children
Specific phobias are common in children and can cause significant distress and impact functioning. Fear of animals (snakes, spiders, dogs) and blood-injection-injury (blood, needles, hospitals) are known to emerge during childhood. In contrast, other situational phobias (eg fear of driving, claustrophobia) usually have a later onset during adolescence. Other specific phobias occur in children, such as fear of loud sounds (balloon popping) and costumed characters (clowns). The prevalence of specific phobias in children is approximately 10 to 35% and the mean age of onset is 5 to 12 years.
For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.
Use psychological interventions (including behavioural therapy with a graded exposure component) as first-line treatment of a specific phobia. Exposure therapy (which may include relaxation strategies) is used to gradually reduce autonomic responses to feared stimuli in the management of a specific phobia. Cognitive reframing, delivered at an age-appropriate level, may also be used to address worries and fears related to a specific phobia in a child. Virtual-reality exposure is emerging as a convenient approach, but it is not clear if it is superior to real-world exposure.
Pharmacotherapy is rarely indicated for managing a specific phobia in a child. If the phobia results in extreme incapacitation and pharmacotherapy is considered, refer to a child psychiatrist or age-appropriate mental health service."
stopping-antidepressants,"Approach to stopping an antidepressant
Although long-term antidepressant therapy may be required, rates of antidepressant use in Australia (1 in 10 adults take an antidepressant) suggest antidepressant therapy is continued unnecessarily in some people.
Consider stopping a person’s antidepressant treatment if:
In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to switch to another antidepressant rather than stopping antidepressant therapy.
Stopping or switching an antidepressant may be considered because a patient wishes to become pregnant, or is pregnant or breastfeeding.
Discontinuation symptoms can occur when stopping an antidepressant. Discontinuation symptoms vary between antidepressants, but can include insomnia, nausea, postural imbalance, sensory disturbances, hyperarousal, influenza-like symptoms and, rarely, delirium. Discontinuation symptoms are usually mild and last 1 to 2 weeks (but can last a month or longer in some patients). If severe, restarting the antidepressant will resolve the symptoms promptly; a slower dose reduction can be used to avoid discontinuation symptoms.
If relapse occurs after stopping an antidepressant, consider whether long-term pharmacotherapy is required.
In some circumstances, another psychotropic will be started when the antidepressant is stopped; antidepressant discontinuation symptoms may be mistaken for adverse effects of the new drug. This can lead to the dose of the new drug being inappropriately reduced or the drug being stopped. If clinical circumstances permit, slowly stop the antidepressant, allow time for discontinuation symptoms to manifest, then introduce the new drug.
Plan antidepressant discontinuation with the patient. To facilitate stopping an antidepressant:

Gradual dose reduction to stop an antidepressant
Reduce the dose of the antidepressant gradually, rather than stopping it abruptly, to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. For example, reduce the antidepressant dose by 25 to 50% every 1 to 4 weeks until the daily dose is half the lowest unit strength available [Note 1]. Continue at the lowest dose for 2 weeks then stop.
However, if a serious adverse effect has occurred, reduce the dose more rapidly.
Conversely, use a slower dose reduction schedule than described above if discontinuation symptoms are more likely; for example, when stopping:
A gradual dose reduction is not usually required for fluoxetine because fluoxetine and its active metabolite have a long half-life; discontinuation symptoms rarely occur."
stopping-antipsychotics,"Stopping an antipsychotic
The advice in this topic is intended to support the practical implementation of the antipsychotic recommendations for adults and young people with bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders. For advice on stopping an antipsychotic used for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, see here.
Ideally, stop antipsychotic therapy in collaboration with the patient’s psychiatrist, mental health team or a practitioner experienced in stopping antipsychotics. Most patients value a trial of stopping antipsychotic therapy and may do so without consulting their treatment team. When considering stopping antipsychotic therapy for a psychotic disorder, discuss the significant potential for relapse with the patient; most people who experience a first episode of psychosis experience a relapse after stopping treatment.
Avoid abruptly stopping an antipsychotic because this increases the risk of adverse drug withdrawal effects and rebound psychosis, which is characterised by rapid symptom onset, pronounced positive symptoms, agitation and relative treatment resistance. However, it may be necessary to immediately stop an antipsychotic if a serious adverse effect (eg neuroleptic malignant syndrome) occurs.
Plan antipsychotic discontinuation with the patient and, if the patient consents, their family, carers or significant others. To facilitate stopping an antipsychotic:

Cholinergic rebound syndrome due to an antipsychotic
Cholinergic rebound syndrome can be caused by stopping or reducing the dose of an antipsychotic with significant anticholinergic properties, or switching to an antipsychotic with less anticholinergic properties. Symptoms are influenza-like (eg malaise, myalgia, rhinorrhoea); nausea, vomiting and agitation can also occur.
If cholinergic rebound syndrome occurs, reduce the rate of dose reduction. If this is ineffective or symptoms are severe, use:
If the above measures are ineffective, seek specialist advice."
substance-induced-psychosis,"Substance-induced psychosis
Transient psychotic symptoms can be caused by intoxication with a substance (eg stimulants, hallucinogens, gamma-hydroxybutyrate [GHB], ketamine) or, more rarely, withdrawal from a substance (eg alcohol, benzodiazepines). Symptoms development is related to the time the substance was last ingested, and symptom duration is usually brief. Occasionally, perceptual abnormalities (eg flashbacks to hallucinogen use) occur sometime after the last use of the substance. Predominant psychotic symptoms are hallucinations or delusions, but a degree of insight is usually preserved; disordered thoughts or blunted affect do not usually occur, although an amotivational state can occur with chronic cannabis use. For advice on managing a person who is intoxicated, see the Toxicology and Toxinology guidelines.
Psychotic symptoms that continue for longer than can be attributed to intoxication with or withdrawal from a substance may be due to a substance-induced psychotic disorder. This can be triggered by substance use in people with risk factors for psychosis (eg genetic susceptibility). Seek psychiatric advice for treatment of substance-induced psychosis, which can include treating problem substance use, supporting sobriety, and antipsychotic therapy. If a substance-induced psychotic disorder continues for longer than 4 weeks, it is likely to be another psychotic disorder (eg schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia).

Some substances and drugs can induce symptoms similar to those of major depression. Symptoms either:

Symptoms are expected to resolve over a period of days to a few weeks after withdrawal of the inducing agent—this would confirm a diagnosis of substance- or drug-induced depressive disorder. If symptoms persist beyond this time, consider another disorder that can cause depressive symptoms.
If it is not possible to withdraw the drug, assess the severity of depressive symptoms and treat accordingly (see Assessing a person with depressive symptoms)."
subthreshold-depressive-symptoms,"Subthreshold depressive symptoms
Patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms (eg persistent depressive disorder) have either:
Consider differential diagnoses in patients presenting with depressive symptoms. Thoroughly assess patients with depressive symptoms, including an assessment of suicide risk.
Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymic disorder) is defined as enduring and often fluctuating, low mood of at least 2 years duration (or 1 year for children) with no more than 2 months without symptoms. Symptoms are insufficient to meet the criteria for major depression but patients may experience episodic exacerbations of symptoms.
Although patients do not meet the criteria for major depression, they still experience psychological distress. Use shared decision making with the patient to decide whether to start treatment for subthreshold depressive symptoms.
The principles of treating subthreshold depressive symptoms are the same as those for major depression (see Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people or Principles of treating major depression in children); however, psychosocial interventions are first line and the use of antidepressants is not routine.
After a benefit–harm analysis, consider using an antidepressant if the patient has:

suicide-risk,"Assessing suicide risk
Suicide is a significant cause of death in Australia. It is the leading cause of death in people aged 15 to 44 years, and the third leading cause of death for people aged 45 to 55 years. Suicide is more common in males than females (75% of suicide deaths are in males), in minority groups, and in individuals with poor socioeconomic status (eg unemployed, homeless, economic insecurity).
Self-harm is a risk factor for suicide, but many patients who self-harm do not report having an intention to die. The management of patients who deliberately self-harm is beyond the scope of these guidelines.
Assessing suicide risk is a standard and crucial component of psychiatric assessments and mental health plans, but it is inherently difficult to reliably predict an individual’s risk of suicide. For examples of risk factors associated with suicide, see Table 8.24—this is not an exhaustive list of risk factors or a ‘check list’ for assessing suicide risk. Use the risk factors for suicide as a prompt to inform discussions with the patient.
Risk factors for suicide can be:
While it is very difficult to predict an individual’s behaviour, the presence of static and dynamic risk factors is associated with suicide or severe self-harm and should raise concern and instigate referral to an acute psychiatric service or acute mental health team. However, the number of risk factors present does not correlate to the level of risk. Evidence suggests it is a change in dynamic risk factors that exposes an individual to imminent risk of suicide (eg a change in dynamic factors in a psychiatric patient with recurrent suicidal thoughts, who has a combination of static risk factors).
Obtain a thorough history from the patient, and where relevant consult with their family, carers or significant others. Box 8.43 outlines key questions to ask when assessing suicide risk.
It is important to differentiate patients who are suicidal from patients who have suicidal thoughts—although many patients have thoughts about ending their life, only some patients have an intent to die. There are a range of factors that indicate these thoughts go further than a passing idea of death providing relief from their current suffering, to an actual risk that they may act on these thoughts (eg they have current intent, a specific plan, access to means or have had previous suicide attempts).

Questions to ask when assessing suicide risk
If a suicide attempt has been made

Managing patients with suicidal risk
Prevention of suicide is difficult and not always possible. Safety planning is the first step to take as an intervention for all patients where suicide risk is identified. Develop a safety plan in collaboration with a patient at risk of suicide; a safety plan outlines actions the patient can take to manage suicidal thoughts and reduce the risk of acting on them.
If the patient has a significant risk of suicide (eg they have current intent, a specific plan, access to means or have had previous suicide attempts), early consultation or referral to an acute psychiatric service or acute mental health team is indicated. If the risk of suicide is extremely high, consider involuntary treatment [Note 1].
Develop a comprehensive safety plan [Note 2] for patients at risk of suicide (which may involve a multidisciplinary approach), including:
Helplines and support services for people at risk of suicide include:
If the patient is acutely agitated, if possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm.
If the patient remains acutely agitated and is at risk of harming themselves or others, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for advice.
For information on assessing and responding to suicidal thoughts in patients receiving palliative care, see Suicidal ideation in palliative care.

Prescribing considerations in a patient at risk of suicide
Drug overdoses are commonly taken during suicide attempts. Older and frail people are at higher risk of fatal toxicity in an overdose because of an increased likelihood of having multiple comorbidities, resulting in potential drug–drug and drug–disease interactions.
If a patient is at risk of suicide, limit access to drugs that can be harmful in overdose; for example:

Principles of using drugs associated with emergent suicidality
Suicidal thoughts and behaviours can emerge when starting and stopping drugs (both psychotropic and nonpsychotropic drugs). Consider the harms and benefits of using a drug associated with emergent suicidality. Additional caution is needed in a patient considered to be at risk of suicide (see Assessing suicide risk).
When using a drug associated with emergent suicidality, inform the patient of the risk of developing suicidal thoughts. If the patient is at risk of suicide, consider using an alternative drug if possible. If starting a drug associated with emergent suicidality (eg antidepressant therapy), develop an action plan to follow, should suicidal thoughts occur. As a precaution, schedule regular reviews with the patient (and their family, carers or significant others if applicable)—review during the first 7 to 10 days, at least weekly during the first month of treatment, and at least fortnightly during the second month. Additionally, review frequently when changing the dose or stopping drug therapy."
switching-antidepressants,"Switching antidepressants
When switching antidepressants, 3 methods can be used.
There is limited evidence on the most appropriate method for switching between antidepressants. Choose the approach based on:
Unless there is a need to stop the antidepressant urgently (eg severe adverse effect), gradually reduce the dosage of the first antidepressant to minimise the risk of discontinuation symptoms.
Discontinuation symptoms can arise when stopping an antidepressant. If switching from an antidepressant with a higher risk of discontinuation symptoms (eg paroxetine, venlafaxine), a drug-free interval may be preferable, except in urgent clinical situations (eg patients who are severely depressed, suicidal or psychotic).
Rapid switch and cross-tapering methods require an experienced clinician because drug interactions and serotonin toxicity are more likely with these methods. Keep in mind that discontinuation symptoms from the antidepressant that has been stopped may be misattributed to adverse effects of the new antidepressant. See Stopping treatment with an antidepressant for further information about discontinuation symptoms.
If using the drug-free interval method, see Table 8.29 for recommendations; these are based on the pharmacokinetics of the drug to be stopped and any active metabolites. Interpret these recommendations in the context of each patient’s situation (eg doses of the drugs, concurrent drugs, physical health).
Regardless of the method used to switch antidepressants, create a management plan that includes:
If significant adverse effects emerge during the changeover period, the plan may need to be adjusted.

switching-antipsychotics,"Switching antipsychotics
The advice in this topic is intended to support the practical implementation of the antipsychotic recommendations for adults and young people with bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders.
A switch of antipsychotic may be required because of poor treatment response, adverse effects or patient request.
If a switch is being considered because of poor treatment response, first check whether the poor response can be explained by other factors (see Box 8.41 for psychotic disorders, Box 8.17 for acute mania, Box 8.18 for bipolar depression and Box 8.19 for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder). If nonadherence is identified as the cause of poor treatment response, determine barriers to adherence (eg antipsychotic adverse effects, impaired insight, cognitive impairment, lack of community or family support, psychosocial factors including financial, inadequate community treatment and lack of patient or caregiver education). These barriers may be the focus of treatment (eg addressing factors contributing to nonadherence) or guide the subsequent antipsychotic selection. If negative symptoms of psychosis are inadequately treated, see the management advice here before switching antipsychotics.
If treatment response is adequate but the patient is experiencing adverse effects, see here for management options to consider before switching antipsychotics.
Before switching antipsychotics, discuss the potential harms (eg relapse, temporary exacerbation of adverse effects) and benefits (eg improved symptom control, eventual reduction in adverse effects) of a switch with the patient and, if the patient consents, their family, carers or significant others.
If the decision is made to switch antipsychotics:
The speed of a switch between oral antipsychotics depends on the pharmacokinetics of the antipsychotics (check a drug information resource for guidance), whether the patient is acutely unwell or stable, and the setting in which the switch is undertaken (eg hospital, community). For example:
For information about switching from an oral to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulation, see here for psychotic disorders and here for bipolar disorder.
When switching from a long-acting injectable to an oral antipsychotic formulation, stop the long-acting injectable and start a low dose of the oral antipsychotic on the date the next injection was due. Gradually increase the dose of the oral formulation—concentrations of long-acting injectable antipsychotics remain elevated for weeks to months depending on their pharmacokinetics (check a drug information resource). The exception to this approach is long-acting injectable risperidone; start the replacement oral antipsychotic early enough to achieve a therapeutically equivalent dose 3 weeks after the last risperidone injection (which is when the risperidone concentration is expected to rapidly drop). Adverse effects arising during the switch may be caused by the long-acting formulation (either an interaction with the new antipsychotic or withdrawal adverse effects) or the oral antipsychotic. If symptoms return after the long-acting injectable formulation drops to clinically insignificant concentrations (usually 2 to 5 months after the last dose, depending on pharmacokinetics), this can indicate the oral antipsychotic is inadequately dosed; also consider other factors for nonresponse."
tourette-syndrome,"Overview of Tourette syndrome
Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder with childhood onset that can cause significant social disability. The disorder is characterised by multiple motor tics and one or more recurrent vocal tics. Tourette syndrome is more common in males than females. Severity typically peaks during adolescence with many children experiencing a substantial reduction in severity by early adulthood. The prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is greatly increased among children with Tourette syndrome.
Typically, motor tics begin between the ages of 3 and 8 years, with vocal tics appearing several years later. Vocal tics can involve sniffing, grunting, swallowing, coughing, barking, whistling or uttering expletives. Tics occur many times a day, are present over a period longer than 1 year and there is often a waxing and waning pattern of severity, intensity and frequency.
If Tourette syndrome is suspected, refer to a specialist for confirmation of the diagnosis.
Most people with Tourette syndrome have a comorbid psychiatric disorder, which can have a greater impact on the patient than the tics. Effective management of psychiatric comorbidities may reduce tic intensity.
Symptoms of Tourette syndrome should be differentiated from transient simple motor tics of less than 6 months duration, which are common in otherwise healthy children. Advice and support for children and parents is the best management in these circumstances. For the management of tics not associated with Tourette syndrome, see here.
Nonpharmacological treatment is first line for management of Tourette syndrome. If Tourette syndrome is severe or debilitating, consider using pharmacotherapy. While Tourette syndrome improves significantly in adulthood, a minority of adults will continue to have significant symptoms and may require continued treatment.

Nonpharmacological treatment for Tourette syndrome
Providing psychoeducation to patients, parents, teachers and peers and exploring associated coping strategies is typically sufficient for most people with Tourette syndrome, unless tics are severe or debilitating.
Identify and address any specific environmental stresses or precipitants that may exacerbate the condition.
The most studied nonpharmacological intervention for Tourette syndrome is habit reversal training [Note 1]. Patients usually experience an urge to tic called the ‘premonitory sensation’, which is often relieved by performing the tic. For most patients, this is an automatic and involuntary process. However, through awareness training, patients can become more aware of this urge and use competing responses to oppose the tic.
The Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT) involves habit reversal training and psychosocial support. Randomised controlled trial evidence has demonstrated that Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics is effective in children and adults. Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics addresses tics sequentially.
There is preliminary evidence to suggest that exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy may also be effective in the treatment of tics. This therapy encourages patients to fully experience urges to tic while actively suppressing tics during therapeutic sessions. Unlike Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics, exposure and response prevention focuses on all tics at the same time.
Adults who have severe, refractory tics that cause significant impairment in functioning may be treated with other therapies, including deep brain stimulation.

Pharmacotherapy for Tourette syndrome in children
Pharmacotherapy should be prescribed by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children—follow the principles of psychotropic use in children.
Pharmacotherapy may be considered for Tourette syndrome if tics cause pain or injury, cause sustained academic, social or emotional difficulties for the child, or interfere significantly with the child’s functioning in other areas. However, pharmacotherapy rarely achieves complete suppression of all tics; instead, treatment aims to reduce the tic frequency and severity sufficiently, without causing significant adverse effects.
Effective treatment of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms may help reduce tic severity.
If drug therapy is considered appropriate for Tourette syndrome, clonidine is used first line because, despite being less efficacious than antipsychotics, it is not associated with significant adverse effects. Clonidine may be more effective for Tourette syndrome in children with comorbid ADHD, and can also have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms. Use:
Although slowly increasing the dose of clonidine (as above) limits sedation and hypotension, routinely measure blood pressure and pulse rate during treatment. Avoid stopping treatment suddenly because of the risk of rebound hypertension.
If Tourette syndrome is not well controlled with clonidine, consider using an antipsychotic. Antipsychotics with some evidence for reducing tic severity include risperidone and aripiprazole [Note 3]. There is limited evidence for ziprasidone for reducing tic severity. Haloperidol has some evidence of efficacy for Tourette syndrome, but its use is limited by its risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Pimozide is no longer used due to cardiovascular adverse effects.
Discuss the following with the patient and their family, carers or significant others so they can make an informed decision about antipsychotic use:
If antipsychotic therapy is agreed upon, perform baseline tests to guide antipsychotic choice and to give a reference point for future monitoring. For a schedule for monitoring antipsychotic adverse effects, see here.
If an antipsychotic is considered appropriate for treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome, use:
If a patient develops adverse effects while taking an antipsychotic, see here.

Pharmacotherapy for Tourette syndrome in adults
While Tourette syndrome improves significantly in adulthood, a minority of adults will continue to have significant tics and may require continued treatment. Drug choice and dosing in adults is similar to that in children; however, treatment should be guided by a specialist."
transcranial-magnetic-stimulation,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive treatment that uses a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce weak electric currents in the cerebral cortex and stimulate nerve cells.
There is considerable evidence to support TMS for patients with major depression who have not responded to or have only partially responded to antidepressants. There is insufficient evidence to support TMS as first-line treatment of major depression, and its role in preventing relapse of depression is unclear. TMS is less effective than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for more severe cases of major depression.
TMS is a relatively new treatment and its application to other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia or obsessive compulsive disorder, is under investigation.
TMS is administered by trained psychiatrists in an outpatient setting and does not require anaesthesia. Treatment is administered as a series of repeated pulses (repetitive TMS [rTMS]). The frequency of treatment sessions and total duration of the treatment course is variable and determined by the treating psychiatrist, but is usually administered as daily treatment sessions over a course of 2 to 4 weeks. Further courses of TMS may be considered, but the role of maintenance TMS is unclear.
TMS is generally well tolerated; induction of a seizure is an extremely rare adverse effect. Depending on stimulus parameters, patients may experience local scalp discomfort and headaches. Unlike ECT, there are few interactions between psychotropics and TMS, but any changes to pharmacotherapy should be made under the guidance of the treating psychiatrist.
Evidence to support the use of TMS in pregnancy is limited, but suggests it improves symptoms of depression and is unlikely to cause harm."
