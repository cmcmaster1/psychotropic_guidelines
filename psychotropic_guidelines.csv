Depending on the patientâs baseline symptoms, weight and medical status, the patient and fetus may require more frequent monitoring than usual, using blood tests (to detect anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbance and nutritional deficiencies) and ultrasounds (to monitor fetal growth).

bulimia-nervosa,"<p class=""removeElement"">Bulimia nervosa is a common eating disorder, characterised by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain. It has a community lifetime prevalence of approximately 2% in females and 0.5% in males and has a usual onset during older adolescence and young adulthood. People with a history of trauma (physical, sexual or emotional abuse), restrictive dieting, family history of an eating disorder, or high body mass index (BMI) may be at increased risk of developing bulimia nervosa. Patients usually present many years after the onset of the disorder with concerns about weight loss or medical and psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The signs and symptoms of bulimia nervosa include:<list id=""ptg8-c36-L1"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Patients with bulimia nervosa often present with psychological comorbidities (eg depression, anxiety).

However, advances in technique and administration provide an improved balance between the benefits and harms of ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Treatment approach is individualised to the patient, their disorder and their response to ECT. Individualisation can be achieved through adjustment of ECT parameters, such as current delivered, electrode placement, frequency of treatment. A course of ECT typically consists of multiple sessions, usually administered 2 to 3 times a week. Relapse rates after ECT are high and recovery should be maintained with pharmacotherapy. Occasionally, maintenance ECT is used for patients who do not respond to maintenance pharmacotherapy.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">For advice on ECT during pregnancy, see <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=electroconvulsive-therapy-therapy&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c76-s4#ptg8-c76-s4"" id=""MPS_010949134404209304"" title=""Electroconvulsive therapy during pregnancy"">here</a>.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Common adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) include muscle pain (associated with the muscle relaxant used before the procedure), headaches and transient confusion (lasting for approximately one hour after treatment).</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Many patients have difficulty forming new memories during a treatment course of ECT; they may also already have cognitive impairments due to their underlying disorder. After the course of ECT, memory impairment generally returns to normal; memory may be improved during remission compared to pretreatment functioning. A small proportion of patients experience prolonged confusion or impairment in recall of remote autobiographical memories after a course of ECT. In general, both intra- and post-treatment memory problems are less with unilateral than bilateral ECT, and particularly less with ultraâbrief current ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">A plan for managing psychotropics during and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) should be developed by the patientâs psychiatrist in collaboration with the psychiatrist administering ECT. Some psychotropics may need to be stopped before ECT. The following information is included for reference only, for nonspecialists.</p><br><p class=""removeElement""><b>Benzodiazepines</b> raise the seizure threshold and may impair the efficacy of ECT, and should be stopped before ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">There are limited benefits to continuing the patientâs <b>antidepressant</b> during ECT; some studies suggest that concurrent antidepressant use may increase the risk of adverse effects. Generally, all antidepressants should be stopped before administering ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Although <b>lithium</b> does not impair the effectiveness of ECT, it may result in severe postictal confusion even at a low blood concentration. The treating psychiatrists should decide on the best approach to managing lithium during ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Continuing an <b>antiepileptic</b> is likely to reduce the efficacy of ECT, prolong the course of ECT and impair cognition. In patients with epilepsy, antiepileptics should not usually be stopped because this increases the risk of seizures. In patients taking antiepileptics for the management of bipolar disorder, antiepileptics are ideally stopped before or early in the course of ECT. If required, antiepileptics can be restarted at the end of the course of ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">For psychoses, an <b>antipsychotic</b> should be continued unless clearly ineffective or adversely interacting with ECT (eg seizures related to clozapine use during ECT). Limited evidence suggests that outcomes when combining antipsychotics with ECT are better than for either treatment alone.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The stigma and anxiety associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be amplified during pregnancy; this can be a barrier to ECT for clinicians and patients. However, ECT is an important component of therapy for several psychiatric disorders. Failing to use ECT when indicated can increase the risk of harm to the patient and fetus, due to suicidality, impulsivity and self-neglect.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Although inadequate treatment of psychiatric disorders is associated with adverse outcomes for the patient and fetus, ECT can also cause adverse effects. In addition to its usual <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=electroconvulsive-therapy-therapy&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c76-s2#ptg8-c76-s2"" id=""MPS_022528286107622897"" title=""Adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy"">adverse effects</a>, ECT during pregnancy can cause mild vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, transient benign fetal arrhythmias, uterine contractions (mostly transient) and preterm delivery. Some case reports and series describe relatively high rates of fetal adverse events (up to 29%); however, safety data are limited and there are insufficient high-quality data to determine a causal link with ECT.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">ECT is an option if a pregnant patient usually takes a teratogenic psychotropic (eg sodium valproate) and alternative treatments cannot be used.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">To prepare a pregnant patient for ECT, follow the same process as for nonpregnant patients, but also consult with the patientâs obstetricianâECT should be used with caution if the patient has a condition that could lead to placental compromise (eg hypertension, diabetes). The anaesthetic care for pregnant patients undergoing ECT should be undertaken by an anaesthetist with expertise in ECT in pregnancy.

Immediate-release melatonin is not registered in Australia, but is available via the <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=drug-availability-in-palliative-care&amp;sectionId=pcg4-c28-s3#pcg4-c28-s3"" id=""MPS_038799193218334294"" title=""Unregistered medicines and the Special Access Scheme"">Special Access Scheme</a> and from compounding pharmacies.

Although modified-release melatonin is registered in Australia for insomnia in adults aged 55 years or older, it is relatively ineffective for jetlag. If a suitable immediate-release melatonin formulation is not available, the modified-release formulation, taken 60 to 120 minutes on the plane before bedtime of the final destination and continued for up to 3 subsequent nights may be considered.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Avoid combining melatonin with other sedating drugs (eg hypnotics) to aid sleep; the benefits of this practice are unclear and it may cause further sedation.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Limited evidence suggests that <b>hypnotics</b> may reduce jet lagârelated insomnia in adults; however, unlike melatonin, hypnotics do not help circadian phase shift. The modest potential benefits of hypnotics may be outweighed by their significant adverse effects including amnesia, confusion, dangerous sleep-related behaviours and risk of dependence. Hypnotic induced-immobility on the plane may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (ie deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE])âsee below for further advice.

obsessive-compulsive-disorder,"<p class=""removeElement"">Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted. In most people, obsessions cause marked anxiety or distress. The person usually attempts to ignore or suppress these thoughts, impulses or images, or to counter them by performing a compulsion. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours (eg hand washing, checking) or mental acts (eg counting) that the person feels compelled to undertake in response to an obsession in order to prevent discomfort, or a dreaded event that the compulsion cannot realistically affect. The person usually recognises that their behaviour is excessive or unreasonable.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The obsessions or compulsions can significantly interfere with the personâs life and can impact people living or working with them.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The lifetime prevalence of OCD is 2 to 2.5%. Childhood OCD occurs in the same form as that seen in adults and usually manifests between 5 and 15 years.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can be particularly challenging during the perinatal period.</p><br><p class=""removeElement""><b>Antenatal</b> OCD can cause significant distress and <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=overview-anxiety-disorders&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c06-s3#ptg8-c06-s3"" id=""MPS_016649593099484106"" title=""Considerations in managing anxiety disorders during the perinatal period"">poorer perinatal outcomes</a>. Specific behaviours may affect the pregnancy (eg obsessions about contaminated food may lead to restricted eating and malnutrition). OCD is more prevalent among pregnant females than those who are not pregnant; up to 40% of females who develop OCD experience its onset during pregnancy.</p><br><p class=""removeElement""><b>Postnatal</b> OCD can impair a parentâs ability to care for their infant.<list id=""ptg8-c11-L1"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Thoughts of intentional infant harm (eg physical or sexual abuse) are distressing but common after a person gives birth. Most people dismiss such thoughts but people with OCD may obsess over them and become concerned about unwillingly acting upon them. This can lead them to experience feelings of extreme guilt and fear, and worry that they want to harm their infant or there is âsomething wrong with themâ.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If a person expresses thoughts of harming their infant, determine whether there is a risk of infant harm (eg the patient has delusions that could indicate <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=postpartum-psychosis"" id=""MPS_07287501729884087"" title=""Postpartum psychosis"">postpartum psychosis</a> and potential for infanticide or suicide; the patient expresses definite intent).

Overreacting (eg by reporting a patient with OCD to child protection services or not allowing them to be alone with their infant) can worsen OCD, disrupt the family and impair parentâinfant attachment. Comorbid severe depression, psychosis, substance use disorders and reduced impulse control (eg personality disorder) pose a higher risk of infant harm.

parasomnias,"<p class=""removeElement"">Parasomnias are undesirable behaviours or experiences that occur while falling asleep, sleeping or waking.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Parasomnias are classified into 3 broad groups according to the stage of sleep in which they occur:<list id=""ptg8-c45-L1"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleepwalking are disorders of arousal from nonârapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. During these parasomnias, which typically occur during the first half of sleep, a person appears to be awake and asleep at the same time. Upon waking, the event is usually not remembered.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">A <b>sleep terror</b> (night terror) is characterised by an intense feeling of fear often accompanied by screaming and crying, violent thrashing movements and autonomic activation (eg sweating and tachycardia). The person may not wake during the sleep terror but, if they do, can be disorientated.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">A <b>confusional arousal</b> is characterised by confusion upon arousal from sleep. The person may sit up in bed, look around and speak, but appear confused and unaware of their surroundings. These episodes are short; the person usually returns to sleep.</p><br><p class=""removeElement""><b>Sleepwalking</b> occurs when a person who is asleep walks and potentially engages in an activity (eg talking, driving, cooking, moving furniture).</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Non-REM parasomnias are common and most frequently occur in children. Stress, sleep deprivation, drugs (especially alcohol, zolpidem, lithium), physical illness and other sleep disorders (eg sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements) can be precipitants. If a non-REM parasomnia first presents in adulthood, it is likely to be caused by an adverse drug effect, stress or a neurological disorder (eg sleep-related epilepsy).</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Manage a non-REM parasomnia by educating the person and their significant other(s) about the condition. Patient information on sleep terrors and sleep walking is available on the Sleep Health Foundation <a href=""https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/fact-sheets.html"" id=""url-ref_8"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. The Royal Childrenâs Hospital provides advice for parents with children who have sleep terrors (see <a href=""https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Night_Terrors_night_time_wakings/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) or sleepwalk (see <a href=""https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Sleepwalking/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">As people do not usually recall non-REM parasomnias, distress may be minimised by not waking them during an episode. If a drug is suspected to be causing the parasomnia, reduce the dose or stop the drug if possible. If lack of sleep is a likely precipitant, see <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=insomnia-adults&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c40-s3#ptg8-c40-s3"" id=""MPS_0016296664624713575"" title=""Principles of treating insomnia in adults"">here</a> for advice for adults and the Raising Children <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au"" target=""_blank"">website</a> for advice for children and adolescents.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If <b>sleepwalking</b> is frequent or dangerous to the patient or others, make the sleeping environment safe.

However, sleep specialists will sometimes use a benzodiazepine if sleepwalking or sleep terrors are significantly affecting the patientâs quality of life or placing them or those around them in danger, and other interventions are ineffective.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">A nightmare is a disturbing dream that usually occurs late in sleep, during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase. Upon wakening, the person will quickly orientate and vividly remember the nightmare, which can cause distress. Nightmares are common (particularly in children) and most often, are a normal part of life, not requiring treatment. However, if nightmares are recurrent and cause significant distress or functional impairment, further investigation is required.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Recurrent nightmares featuring a repeated story are commonly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)âsee <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=mental-health-disorders-following-trauma"" id=""MPS_06718686798501832"" title=""Mental health disorders following trauma exposure"">here</a> for PTSD diagnosis and management, including management of nightmares.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Some drugs (eg beta blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists) can cause vivid dreams or nightmares. If a drug is suspected to be the cause of ongoing nightmares, consider adjusting the time of administration, reducing the dose or stopping the drugâoften nightmares will then resolve. Conversely, withdrawing or stopping drugs that suppress REM sleep (eg alcohol, antidepressants, some hypnotics) can precipitate nightmares.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If recurrent nightmares appear to have no clear cause, consider psychological therapies (eg imagery rehearsal therapy, <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c77-s3#ptg8-c77-s3"" id=""MPS_06860251276188227"" title=""Cognitive behavioural therapy"">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>). If these therapies are not effective or unavailable, seek specialist advice for further treatment options.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by complex motor activity and vocal dream enactment behaviour associated with loss of normal REM muscle tone (atonia). This parasomnia can result in violent and dangerous behaviour during sleep. REM sleep behaviour disorder is predominantly seen in older people and affects more males than females (ratio 9:1). In most patients, REM sleep behaviour disorder precedes or is associated with alpha synucleinopathies (eg Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple systems atrophy). REM sleep behaviour disorder is occasionally associated with other neurological disorders (eg narcolepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders) or drugs (eg alcohol, antidepressants, beta blockers).</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If REM sleep behaviour disorder is suspected, refer the patient to a sleep specialist or neurologist for evaluation and treatment. Differential diagnoses include nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, posttraumatic stress disorder and other parasomnias.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Counsel the patient about ways to make their sleep environment safer (eg remove furniture or objects near the bed that could cause injury; move the bed away from windows; avoid sleeping with other people). If REM sleep behaviour disorder is violent or poses a risk of injury, specialists sometimes use melatonin or clonazepam.</p>"

Personality is considered normal when it allows a person to adapt to their circumstances and environment, but what is considered normal can depend on cultural norms (eg high emotional expression is expected in some societies but not others). Personality disorder occurs when features of a personâs personality are inflexible or maladaptive, and interfere with the personâs ability to adapt to or manage changes in their circumstances or environment. Personality disorder involves both:<list id=""ptg8-c47-L1"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The aetiology of personality disorder is complex, involving an interplay between factors that predispose a person to a vulnerable temperament (eg familial risk, prenatal exposures), deficits in the caregiving environment in infancy, and ongoing maladaptive social experiences [<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""MPS_d1e63"" onclick=""navigateRef('n_ptg8-c47-fn1','toc_d1e47')"" title=""Note 1"">Note 1</a>]. This results in the deficits in emotional regulation and social communication seen in a person with personality disorder. Although adverse life experiences in childhood (eg trauma, abuse, neglect) are associated with personality disorder, and should be considered when personality disorder is suspected, adverse experiences are nonspecific to personality disorder. In addition, some patients with personality disorder report no adversity in childhood.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Personality disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, the prevalence in clinical settings is higher because people with personality disorder seek treatment more frequentlyâpersonality disorder is prevalent in a quarter of patients attending primary care and up to half of patients attending specialist psychiatric services.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Personality disorder usually becomes apparent during the transition from childhood to adulthood, when the capacity for self-reflection and a life narrative is developed.

Suspect personality disorder in a person who has persistent interpersonal difficulties (eg difficulties with empathy, intimacy, understanding othersâ perspectives, managing conflict) or difficulties in self-management (eg identity disturbance, self-reflection, self-worth).

However, this approach is problematic because the categories are overlapping, lack validity, and no clear threshold exists between types and degrees of personality disorders.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">In contemporary practice, personality disorder is classified according to its severity, which may be accompanied by a specifier that describes the prominent personality traits or patterns characteristic of the person.

A borderline pattern is specified if the person has a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image and affects, and marked impulsivity; this is considered the most severe specifier and is synonymous with borderline personality disorder in the categorical classification system.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Because personality disorder is common, all clinicians are likely to encounter patients with personality disorder, and will need to employ specific skills to effectively treat them.

It is often helpful for clinicians to remember that, when treating a person with personality disorder, they are usually seeing them at their lowest ebb, when problems are likely to be at their most severe.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Since personality disorder involves difficulties with empathy, intimacy, understanding othersâ perspectives, managing conflict and self-reflection, the therapeutic relationship can become strained at times. The clinician should seek to understand how the person prefers to interact. In expressing their needs, the person may ask the clinician to say or do things that the clinician experiences as unrealistic or demanding. When the clinician is unable to meet these needs the patient may respond with, for example, aggression or extreme emotionality. Clinicians can often feel provoked by such encounters and reciprocate in ways that are often uncharacteristic. A flexible and self-reflective response style, acknowledging the patientâs needs while also letting the patient know the limits of what the clinician can provide, can help to maintain engagement. Clinicians should not be afraid to respectfully discuss their own limits with the patient or to seek advice from their peers.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Strategies to foster an effective therapeutic relationship include collaborative goal setting, being clear about mutual expectations and acceptable behaviour, encouraging the patient to develop self-control, and helping the patient to associate feelings with events and actions. Use a structured approach to personality disorder problems following the key principles in <a href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""MPS_d1e370"" onclick=""navigateRef('ptg8-c47-box1','toc_d1e195')"" title=""Box 8.37"">Box 8.37</a>. Discuss the case with other clinicians.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The terms used to describe personality disorder are sometimes used inappropriately, or in a pejorative manner. This may serve to stigmatise personality disorder and lead to inadequate assessment and treatment, or even denial of service. Personality disorder is a treatable conditionâthe behaviours that people with personality disorder display (eg being âdifficultâ or antisocial, severe emotional or interpersonal dysregulation) should not be a reason to exclude them from a health service or deny treatment.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">This stigma is most often perpetuated by health professionals and it is the responsibility of all clinicians to be proactive and educate their peers when this occurs. To address the stigma that currently surrounds a diagnosis of personality disorder, have an open and honest discussion with the patient at the time of diagnosis (see <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=personality-disorder&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c47-s3#ptg8-c47-s3"" id=""MPS_07763574596904841"" title=""Psychoeducation for personality disorder"">Psychoeducation for personality disorder</a>) and record the diagnosis in the patientâs medical history.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Personality disorder can affect a female of childbearing potentialâs sexual health and behaviour (including contraception use), relationships and pregnancies.

The pharmacodynamic response to benzodiazepines can be variable in older people. Suitable oral benzodiazepines for older patients are lorazepam or diazepam. Lorazepam may be safer than diazepam for older people, who often have medical comorbidities such as kidney or liver impairment, because lorazepam does not have active metabolites.

psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders,"<p class=""removeElement"">This topic gives an overview of common psychological interventions that are recommended in these guidelines for the management of psychiatric disorders. It does not contain comprehensive information on all psychological interventions.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Psychological interventions are an important treatment component for psychiatric disorders, either as an alternative or adjunct to pharmacotherapy. The choice of psychological intervention depends on the efficacy of specific interventions for the patientâs psychiatric disorder, the typical needs of patients with that psychiatric disorder, and the needs of the individual patient.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Depending on the intervention, psychological interventions may be delivered by a psychiatrist, psychologist, suitably trained general medical practitioner, counsellor, mental health nurse, social worker or other clinician. They can be delivered individually, as part of a group, <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c77-s13#ptg8-c77-s13"" id=""MPS_07199521563172884"" title=""Online psychological interventions"">online</a> or face-to-face. The patientâs primary treating clinician may refer the patient to a suitable clinician for a psychological intervention. Clinicians involved in the multidisciplinary treatment team should communicate to ensure continuity of care.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a psychological intervention that has its origins in <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c77-s3#ptg8-c77-s3"" id=""MPS_07231680693392075"" title=""Cognitive behavioural therapy"">cognitive behavioural therapy</a> and mindfulness. It focuses on the acceptance of difficult thoughts and emotions that are an inevitable part of life, as well as a commitment towards living life according to values. Acceptance and commitment therapy involves a range of strategies to assist the patient to manage distressing emotions (eg acceptance strategies) and thoughts (eg cognitive defusion techniques), as well as mindful exploration of values and plans for achieving goals.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, emotions and behaviours. It is based on the theory that unhelpful or distorted thinking patterns can lead to distressing emotions and maladaptive behaviours, which can then negatively influence a personâs subsequent thoughts or cognitions. Cognitive behavioural therapy helps the patient to identify and target these unhelpful thoughts, emotions and behaviours.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Cognitive behavioural therapy has 2 focuses:<list id=""ptg8-c77-L1"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Elements of cognitive behavioural therapy (eg activity scheduling, identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts) can be used individually as a brief form of psychological intervention, particularly in primary care settings.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) involves learning skills to manage emotions and relationships more effectively. The goal of treatment is to assist patients to manage problematic thinking patterns, emotions and ineffective behaviours.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The program teaches skills across 4 modules:<list id=""ptg8-c77-L2"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) involves the patient focusing their attention on images, thoughts or sensations associated with traumatic memories while simultaneously also focusing on an external stimulus. The external stimulus is most commonly clinician-directed lateral eye movements, although bilateral tactile tapping or auditory stimulation may also be used. Other components of treatment include replacing negative cognitions of the event with more adaptive ones, and relaxation techniques.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing is guided by the Adaptive Information Processing Model, which postulates that memories formed during traumatic experiences are inadequately processed and when these are recalled, may trigger distressing physiological responses similar to those experienced during the traumatic event itself. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy is believed to result in the traumatic memory being reprocessed into wider memory networks that are more adaptive and less distressing; however, the mechanisms for this process remain uncertain.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The family members of a patient with a psychiatric disorder can benefit from support or therapy themselves, to help manage the effects the psychiatric disorder may have on them and the family system.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Family interventions can range from <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c77-s10#ptg8-c77-s10"" id=""MPS_029722535359771407"" title=""Psychoeducation"">psychoeducation</a> about the patientâs psychiatric disorder, supportive counselling for family members, practical advice on how to support the person experiencing the disorder, and <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=psychological-interventions-psychiatric-disorders&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c77-s6#ptg8-c77-s6"" id=""MPS_009885048975919664"" title=""Family interventions and family therapy"">family therapy</a>. Family interventions can be provided by a general medical practitioner, therapist, or other clinician, or as part of a clinician-led group or community support group.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Family therapy may be beneficial if complex relationships and interactions that exist within the family are a contributing factor to the patientâs psychiatric disorder. Family therapy emphasises relationships as an important factor in psychological health. Addressing issues with family therapy can help to improve the patientâs symptoms and the familyâs level of functioning. There are a range of family therapy approaches.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is based on the theory that interpersonal problems can contribute to the development of mental health issues. It helps the patient to identify and understand interpersonal problems and how they contribute to negative thoughts and feelings, and implement strategies that improve interpersonal functioning. Interpersonal therapy focuses on 4 areas:<list id=""ptg8-c77-L3"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) incorporates aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as well as mindfulness. Patients take part in mindful meditation practices, and are taught to observe, rather than attempt to change, their thoughts and emotions. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy aims to change how patients relate to their thoughts and feelings. It allows them to experience thoughts and feelings as mental events rather than factual representations of themselves or the world, reducing distress and reactivity to thoughts and feelings.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on the theory that unknown or unconscious thoughts and emotions can contribute to the problems a person may be experiencing.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on:<list id=""ptg8-c77-L4"" isedited=""no"" islabel=""no"" list-type=""bullet""></list></p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Psychodynamic psychotherapy can be either short or long term.

suicide-risk,"<p class=""removeElement"">Suicide is a significant cause of death in Australia. It is the leading cause of death in people aged 15 to 44 years, and the third leading cause of death for people aged 45 to 55 years. Suicide is more common in males than females (75% of suicide deaths are in males), in minority groups, and in individuals with poor socioeconomic status (eg unemployed, homeless, economic insecurity).</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Self-harm is a risk factor for suicide, but many patients who self-harm do not report having an intention to die. The management of patients who deliberately self-harm is beyond the scope of these guidelines.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Assessing suicide risk is a standard and crucial component of psychiatric assessments and mental health plans, but it is inherently difficult to reliably predict an individualâs risk of suicide.

The exception to this approach is long-acting injectable risperidone; start the replacement oral antipsychotic early enough to achieve a therapeutically equivalent dose 3 weeks after the last risperidone injection (which is when the risperidone concentration is expected to rapidly drop). Adverse effects arising during the switch may be caused by the long-acting formulation (either an interaction with the new antipsychotic or withdrawal adverse effects) or the oral antipsychotic. If symptoms return after the long-acting injectable formulation drops to clinically insignificant concentrations (usually 2 to 5 months after the last dose, depending on pharmacokinetics), this can indicate the oral antipsychotic is inadequately dosed; also consider other factors for nonresponse.</p>"
tourette-syndrome,"<p class=""removeElement"">Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder with childhood onset that can cause significant social disability. The disorder is characterised by multiple motor tics and one or more recurrent vocal tics. Tourette syndrome is more common in males than females. Severity typically peaks during adolescence with many children experiencing a substantial reduction in severity by early adulthood. The prevalence of <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"" id=""MPS_03359621887069846"" title=""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a> and <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=obsessive-compulsive-disorder"" id=""MPS_05958144841395918"" title=""Obsessive compulsive disorder"">obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)</a> is greatly increased among children with Tourette syndrome.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Typically, motor tics begin between the ages of 3 and 8 years, with vocal tics appearing several years later. Vocal tics can involve sniffing, grunting, swallowing, coughing, barking, whistling or uttering expletives. Tics occur many times a day, are present over a period longer than 1 year and there is often a waxing and waning pattern of severity, intensity and frequency.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If Tourette syndrome is suspected, refer to a specialist for confirmation of the diagnosis.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Most people with Tourette syndrome have a comorbid psychiatric disorder, which can have a greater impact on the patient than the tics. Effective management of psychiatric comorbidities may reduce tic intensity.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Symptoms of Tourette syndrome should be differentiated from transient simple motor tics of less than 6 months duration, which are common in otherwise healthy children. Advice and support for children and parents is the best management in these circumstances. For the management of tics not associated with Tourette syndrome, see <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=tics"" id=""MPS_08943944207353152"" title=""Tics"">here</a>.</p><br><p class=""removeElement""><a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=tourette-syndrome&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c59-s2#ptg8-c59-s2"" id=""MPS_020589229704885237"" title=""Nonpharmacological treatment for Tourette syndrome"">Nonpharmacological treatment</a> is first line for management of Tourette syndrome.

Patients usually experience an urge to tic called the âpremonitory sensationâ, which is often relieved by performing the tic. For most patients, this is an automatic and involuntary process. However, through awareness training, patients can become more aware of this urge and use competing responses to oppose the tic.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">The Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT) involves habit reversal training and psychosocial support. Randomised controlled trial evidence has demonstrated that Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics is effective in children and adults. Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics addresses tics sequentially.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">There is preliminary evidence to suggest that exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy may also be effective in the treatment of tics. This therapy encourages patients to fully experience urges to tic while actively suppressing tics during therapeutic sessions. Unlike Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics, exposure and response prevention focuses on all tics at the same time.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Adults who have severe, refractory tics that cause significant impairment in functioning may be treated with other therapies, including deep brain stimulation.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Pharmacotherapy should be prescribed by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in childrenâfollow the <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=psychotropic-use-children&amp;sectionId=ptg8-c64-s1#ptg8-c64-s1"" id=""MPS_09259878497549561"" title=""Principles of psychotropic use in children"">principles of psychotropic use in children</a>.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Pharmacotherapy may be considered for Tourette syndrome if tics cause pain or injury, cause sustained academic, social or emotional difficulties for the child, or interfere significantly with the childâs functioning in other areas. However, pharmacotherapy rarely achieves complete suppression of all tics; instead, treatment aims to reduce the tic frequency and severity sufficiently, without causing significant adverse effects.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Effective treatment of comorbid <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder"" id=""url-ref_12"" title=""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a> and <a href=""viewTopic?topicfile=obsessive-compulsive-disorder"" title=""Obsessive compulsive disorder"">obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)</a> symptoms may help reduce tic severity.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If drug therapy is considered appropriate for Tourette syndrome, clonidine is used first line because, despite being less efficacious than antipsychotics, it is not associated with significant adverse effects. Clonidine may be more effective for Tourette syndrome in children with comorbid ADHD, and can also have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms. Use:</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">Although slowly increasing the dose of clonidine (as above) limits sedation and hypotension, routinely measure blood pressure and pulse rate during treatment. Avoid stopping treatment suddenly because of the risk of rebound hypertension.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">If Tourette syndrome is not well controlled with clonidine, consider using an antipsychotic. Antipsychotics with some evidence for reducing tic severity include risperidone and aripiprazole [<a href=""javascript:void(0);"" id=""MPS_d1e109"" onclick=""navigateRef('n_ptg8-c59-fn3','toc_d1e87')"" title=""Note 3"">Note 3</a>]. There is limited evidence for ziprasidone for reducing tic severity. Haloperidol has some evidence of efficacy for Tourette syndrome, but its use is limited by its risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects.

Treatment is administered as a series of repeated pulses (repetitive TMS [rTMS]).

Further courses of TMS may be considered, but the role of maintenance TMS is unclear.</p><br><p class=""removeElement"">TMS is generally well tolerated; induction of a seizure is an extremely rare adverse effect. Depending on stimulus parameters, patients may experience local scalp discomfort and headaches.
