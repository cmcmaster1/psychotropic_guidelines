adherence-psychotropics,"Adherence to psychotropics<br>Adherence describes the extent to which a patient’s behaviours (when it comes to taking medicines or participating in other treatments) align with the treatment regimen agreed with their clinician. Deviation from treatment regimens, whether intentional or unintentional, is referred to as nonadherence. High rates of treatment nonadherence have been reported with psychotropics. Nonadherence to psychotropics increases the risk of relapse, hospitalisation, poor quality of life and suicide.<br>Adherence is more likely when clinicians and patients have a good working relationship and jointly participate in deciding on treatment regimens—use shared decision making. Ensure the patient understands the potential advantages of adhering to their treatment regimen and the potential disadvantages associated with treatment nonadherence (eg prematurely reducing or stopping treatment). Involving a local mental health team or patient outreach service can help promote adherence.<br>If treatment nonadherence is identified, raise the issue with the patient in a nonconfrontational manner. Explore the factors that are contributing to treatment nonadherence and implement individualised strategies to improve treatment adherence (see Table 8.25).

adjustment-disorder,"Diagnosing adjustment disorder<br>Adjustment disorder is a time-limited syndrome related to exposure to a stressor that is characterised by:<br>Additionally, adjustment disorder does not represent normal bereavement (see Grief) or meet the criteria for another identifiable psychiatric disorder (eg an anxiety disorder, major depression).<br>Children with adjustment disorder may exhibit behavioural problems (eg fighting, missing school, vandalising property) with or without depressive or anxiety symptoms.<br>If symptoms of adjustment disorder are severe and persistent, and have not responded to treatment, consider alternative diagnoses such as major depression or an anxiety disorder.<br><br>Treating adjustment disorder in adults and young people<br>The primary intervention for adjustment disorder is addressing the triggering psychosocial stressor, if feasible. Although there is little evidence to guide treatment, psychosocial interventions are frequently helpful, including psychoeducation, relaxation strategies, problem solving, stress management, and accommodation and financial guidance. Some patients may benefit from short-term counselling or supportive psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy).<br>Pharmacotherapy has a limited role in managing adjustment disorder—do not use antidepressants because they are not effective.<br>If difficulty sleeping is a significant feature, see Insomnia for treatment.<br>If anxiety symptoms are severe, cause significant functional impairment or have not adequately responded to psychosocial interventions, consider short-term use of a benzodiazepine. However, there is an absence of high-quality evidence for benzodiazepine benefit, and benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence. These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use; in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh the benefits (see Principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders). Intermittent use for severe exacerbations of anxiety is preferable to continuous treatment.<br>If short-term use of a benzodiazepine is required for anxiety associated with adjustment disorder, use:<br>If intermittent dosing is insufficient, use short-term continuous treatment at the lowest effective dose.

advanced-sleep-wake-disorder,"Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder<br>Advanced sleep–wake phase disorder is a circadian rhythm disorder characterised by persistently early sleep onset and wake times (ie at least 2 hours earlier than desired sleep and wake times). Typically, older adults experience advanced sleep–wake phase disorder—they fall asleep between 6.00 and 9.00 pm, before they can complete social, family or work obligations, and wake in the early hours of the morning (between 2.00 and 5.00 am). This causes distress, disruption, reduced sleep time and daytime sleepiness. As such, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as late (or terminal) insomnia. Early morning awakenings can also be as symptom of major depression, which should be excluded.<br>Assess advanced sleep–wake phase disorder with a sleep diary. People with sleep–wake phase disorders tend to sleep less on weekdays, but receive sufficient sleep when sleep is not restricted (eg weekends, holidays). Formal actigraphy can assist with the diagnosis of advanced sleep–wake phase disorder.<br>If a persistently early sleep–wake routine causes daytime sleepiness and dysfunction, treat advanced sleep–wake phase disorder with the following steps to slowly adjust the circadian rhythm to a sleep–wake routine that provides sufficient sleep:<br>To maintain desired sleep–wake routine, advise the patient to:<br>If the above recommendations are not successful, refer the patient to a sleep expert."
agoraphobia,"Agoraphobia<br>Agoraphobia is the fear and avoidance of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing (eg public transport, queues, theatre), or in which help might not be available if the person suddenly develops a symptom that could be incapacitating or embarrassing (eg dizziness, derealisation, loss of bladder or bowel control, a panic attack). As a result of this fear, the person restricts activities, requires the presence of a companion, or endures agoraphobic situations despite intense anxiety.<br>Assess patients who have agoraphobia for other psychiatric disorders because agoraphobia is a common symptom of other anxiety disorders, and can also occur in major depression and psychotic disorders. For example:<br>Most people with agoraphobia develop it as a response to recurrent panic attacks. These panic attacks can also be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disorder.<br>Treatment involves managing the underlying condition and treating panic attacks, if they are a feature. Once anxiety is sufficiently reduced, use behavioural therapy with graded exposure to overcome the phobic avoidance.<br>For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.<br>For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here."
anorexia-nervosa,"Overview of anorexia nervosa<br>Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder characterised by restricted energy intake resulting in:<br>It is associated with significant morbidity (eg physiological effect associated with starvation, depression, anxiety) and mortality.<br>Anorexia nervosa has an estimated global lifetime prevalence of approximately 1% and affects females more than males (females account for approximately 90% of diagnoses). The disorder has a typical onset during mid to late adolescence and is heritable. People with obsessive or perfectionist traits, a history of trauma (emotional, sexual or physical abuse), restrictive dieting or familial leanness are at increased risk of developing the disorder.<br>There are 2 subtypes of anorexia nervosa, distinguished by the methods the person has used in the preceding months to restrict energy intake:<br>Patients with anorexia nervosa often present with medical complications (eg osteopenia) and psychological comorbidities (eg depression, anxiety); some complications may present many years after the disease onset.<br>Screening questions can be used to detect the possible presence of an eating disorder in those considered to be at risk. The SCOFF questionnaire is a screening tool validated for use in primary care.<br>Do you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full?<br>Do you worry that you have lost Control over how much you eat?<br>Have you recently lost more than One stone (6.35 kg) in a 3-month period?<br>Do you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin?<br>Would you say that Food dominates your life?<br>Each “yes” equals 1 point; a score of 2 indicates a likely diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.<br>Atypical anorexia nervosa is a diagnostic subcategory of the other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). Patients with atypical anorexia nervosa are not considered to be underweight for their age and height (eg have a body mass index (BMI) above 18.5 kg/m2); it is managed similarly to anorexia nervosa.<br><br>Principles of managing anorexia nervosa<br>Managing anorexia nervosa can be challenging; patients may deny the presence or the severity of their disorder, which makes it difficult for the clinician and the patient to agree on the management approach. Patient engagement is key to successful management of anorexia nervosa.<br>Comprehensively assess patients with anorexia nervosa to identify comorbid physical or psychiatric disorders, and any physical complications. Identify and address family and personal problems that may have contributed to the development of the condition.<br>The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (available via the Centre for Research on Eating Disorders at Oxford (CREDO) website) assesses severity of symptoms, which is relevant to accessing care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, see here for current information.<br>The treatment goals for anorexia nervosa are to first restore body weight to an appropriate body mass index (BMI); then to help the patient have a positive relationship with food and eating, by focusing on good psychosocial function and mental wellbeing. A multifaceted approach is required to manage anorexia nervosa, led by an eating disorder–informed therapist (ie a psychologist who is competent in using evidence-based therapies as funded by Medicare for eating disorders) with other health care professionals involved (eg dietician for nutritional restoration). Assessing for and managing medical complications can be lifesaving—barriers and delays in accessing care can have significant impact. Anorexia nervosa can lead to a range of severe cardiac, metabolic, endocrine and bone-related sequelae that may require hospitalisation; hypokalaemia and dehydration are common complications of purging and laxative misuse and can lead to cardiac dysrhythmia.<br>Treatment of anorexia nervosa is usually initiated in an outpatient setting unless the patient:<br>Because of the high levels of morbidity and mortality, consult a specialised eating disorder unit within 6 weeks of diagnosis to initiate an Eating disorder treatment plan (EDTP), even if the patient’s weight loss is not yet marked. Outpatient care is led by a general practitioner, in collaboration with a dietician and psychologist, using an EDTP.<br>Engaging with the community-based healthcare providers is key to ensuring successful management.<br>Use nutritional replenishment and psychological therapies to manage patients with anorexia nervosa. There is no evidence to support the use of pharmacological treatment for anorexia nervosa itself. Pharmacological treatment may be required for the management of medical complications associated with anorexia nervosa and psychiatric comorbidities.<br>The principles of managing atypical anorexia nervosa are similar to those described here, see Atypical anorexia nervosa for differences.<br>For considerations in managing anorexia nervosa in:<br>Outcomes are better for patients with anorexia nervosa who receive treatment early. After receiving treatment, approximately 40% of patients are symptom-free after 5 years. The remainder continue to be symptomatic, and up to 20% of patients are severely affected, with their psychosocial functioning impacted.<br>Family, carers or significant others may have to assume a large burden of care when a patient is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. Useful resources are available from:<br><br>Considerations in managing anorexia nervosa in females of childbearing potential<br>It is preferable for anorexia nervosa to be in remission before pregnancy—otherwise, pregnancy outcomes are poorer. Advise patients with anorexia nervosa to delay conception until their symptoms are well controlled. See here for advice on contraception, preconception planning and the use of psychotropics in females of childbearing potential.<br><br>Considerations in managing anorexia nervosa during pregnancy<br>If a patient has active anorexia nervosa during pregnancy, the pregnancy is considered ‘high risk’ and should be managed by a specialist perinatal unit because of the increased risk of fetal death—admit the patient to hospital as soon as practical [Note 2].<br>Dieting often substantially improves during pregnancy. Some patients fear adverse outcomes from their eating disorder on the pregnancy—this can lead to a time-limited remission. Other patients may develop a recurrence or worsening of their disorder because of anxiety and a fear of loss of control provoked by the weight gain, food cravings and food aversions associated with pregnancy.<br>Usually people with a history of anorexia nervosa have a sufficient diet during pregnancy and do not significantly differ in their nutrient intake and dietary supplement use compared to females without an eating disorder. They are more likely to be diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia.<br>Other than increased fetal mortality rates, the literature about the association between anorexia nervosa and adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are mixed and inconsistent. The finding that is most often replicated is that active anorexia nervosa is associated with smaller infant birth weights. Other adverse outcomes reported include:<br>The treatment of anorexia nervosa during pregnancy follows the same principles as for a nonpregnant patient, see Principles of managing anorexia nervosa. Patients should be treated by a multidisciplinary team involving an obstetrician, psychiatrist (or a specialist eating disorder service), dietitian and physician. Depending on the patient’s baseline symptoms, weight and medical status, the patient and fetus may require more frequent monitoring than usual, using blood tests (to detect anaemia, thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbance and nutritional deficiencies) and ultrasounds (to monitor fetal growth). Ideally, a patient with anorexia nervosa should give birth in a tertiary hospital with specialist neonatal care and a psychiatric team. If this is not possible, seek advice from their psychiatrist and a paediatrician.<br>For advice on psychotropic use during pregnancy, see here.<br><br>Considerations in managing anorexia nervosa in the postpartum<br>In the postpartum, the principles of treating patients with anorexia nervosa are the same as at any other time. Mothers with anorexia nervosa are:<br>Parent–infant interactions tend to involve more control and conflict, and parents can project their distorted body image onto their children. Children of mothers with anorexia nervosa tend to be underweight for their age. Ongoing monitoring and management into the perinatal period is essential for both parent and infant.<br>For advice on psychotropic use while breastfeeding, see here.<br><br>Nutritional replenishment for anorexia nervosa<br>Nutritional replenishment in a patient with anorexia nervosa aims to restore body weight to an appropriate body mass index (BMI) (see Classification of weight according to body mass index). Nutritional replenishment is used in inpatient or outpatient settings, depending on the severity of symptoms and other patient factors (see Principles of managing anorexia nervosa).<br>Involve a dietician experienced in the treatment of eating disorders during nutritional replenishment because there is risk of refeeding syndrome in patients with anorexia nervosa. Refeeding syndrome is a serious and potentially fatal complication of aggressive refeeding of a patient who has been malnourished for a long period of time—it can result in rapid onset of hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia. However, underfeeding a severely malnourished patient in order to reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome, can also have negative consequences. To minimise the risk of refeeding syndrome and complications due to underfeeding, tailor nutritional replenishment to the patient’s needs. Monitor phosphate, potassium and magnesium, and administer electrolyte replacement if required—for management of electrolyte disturbances, see Hypokalaemia, Hypomagnesaemia and Hypophosphataemia. For further information on risks and management of refeeding syndrome, see here.<br><br>Psychological treatment for anorexia nervosa<br>Use psychological treatment in combination with nutritional replenishment in the management of all patients with anorexia nervosa. Specific training and protocols are required for psychological therapies for eating disorders; only a healthcare professional with appropriate expertise in the management of eating disorders (usually a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or occupational therapist) can deliver psychological treatment.<br>If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is present, see Managing psychological comorbidities of anorexia nervosa.<br>For children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa, use:<br>Of these, the most effective is manualised FBT where all family members are seen together—this has demonstrated improved physical and psychological outcomes.

Complications of anorexia nervosa may include:<br>If a complication of anorexia nervosa is secondary to malnutrition (eg fluid and electrolyte changes, pancreatitis), treatment should also include nutritional replenishment. If complications are caused by purging or other behaviours (eg Mallory-Weiss tears, parotid and salivary gland hypertrophy, conjunctival haemorrhage), these behaviours should be addressed with psychological treatment.<br><br>Managing psychiatric comorbidities of anorexia nervosa<br>The core psychiatric symptoms of anorexia nervosa (ie fear of gaining weight and body image disturbance) should be addressed with psychological therapy for anorexia nervosa.<br>Starvation causes psychiatric symptoms of anxiety, dysphoria, depressive symptoms and obsessional thinking, which should improve with nutritional replenishment. However, these symptoms may also be caused by a comorbid psychiatric disorder such as major depression or an anxiety disorder. Patients with anorexia nervosa should receive psychological therapy from a clinician that can differentiate starvation-related symptoms from a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Referral to a psychiatrist may be necessary.<br>If a comorbid psychiatric disorder is identified, refer to the management recommendations for the disorder. In choosing pharmacological treatment, consider the harm–benefit profile of the drug, in particular the:<br>Avoid antidepressants that cause QT-interval prolongation—patients with anorexia nervosa are at increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae because of possible electrolyte disturbances. Of the antidepressants, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline have a lower risk of QT-interval prolongation. For patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 14 kg/m2, start antidepressant treatment at half the usual starting dose; the dose adjustment schedule and maximum dose do not need to be reduced.<br>For management of acute agitation, see Approach to managing acute behavioural disturbance.<br>For ongoing agitation secondary to anorexia nervosa, a psychiatrist may use an antipsychotic or a benzodiazepine. Antipsychotics can reduce anorexic eating-related ruminations, psychological distress and may improve weight gain."
antidepressant-adverse-effects,"Overview of antidepressant adverse effects<br>This topic is intended to aid antidepressant choice by describing the likelihood of individual antidepressants to cause common adverse effects such as weight gain, sexual difficulties, central nervous system adverse effects, anticholinergic effects and gastrointestinal distress.

Antidepressant-induced sexual difficulties can affect both males and females, and include effects on desire (libido), arousal and orgasm. Despite limited evidence of the comparative risk of sexual difficulties with antidepressants, the greatest risk has been observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and clomipramine (see Table 8.28).<br>Consider screening for sexual difficulties before starting an antidepressant then regularly throughout treatment. If the patient has sexual difficulties, consider other causes or contributors—see Low libido in females, Low libido in males, Orgasm difficulties in females, Erectile dysfunction or Premature ejaculation. In some cases, sexual difficulties can persist for some time after stopping an antidepressant, particularly an SSRI or SNRI.<br>There is limited evidence to guide the most appropriate strategy for managing antidepressant-induced sexual difficulties. Although sexual difficulties can resolve spontaneously, this is uncommon. Psychotherapy and physical exercise may improve symptoms.<br>For general strategies to manage antidepressant adverse effects, see here.<br><br>Cardiac conduction disorders with antidepressant use<br>High therapeutic doses of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can cause conduction deficits, which may result in arrhythmias and fatal heart block.

Young people (up to the age of 30 years) are most susceptible to this effect. The mechanism is not fully understood but may relate to the induction of agitation or akathisia.<br>When starting an antidepressant for a patient, discuss the possibility of activation and suicidal thoughts, and develop a plan for responding to these symptoms if they occur. Monitor the patient closely for these effects at the start of treatment. See also Suicide risk.<br><br>Bleeding risk associated with antidepressant use<br>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can increase the risk of bleeding (eg gastrointestinal, uterine, intracranial or periprocedural bleeding). The likelihood of bleeding is increased if the patient has other bleeding risk factors. To minimise bleeding risk in these patients, choose an alternative antidepressant or address other bleeding risk factors (eg using a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection in patients taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID]).<br><br>Hyponatraemia associated with antidepressant use<br>Hyponatraemia can be caused by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Mild hyponatraemia is usually asymptomatic but patients may experience nausea and general malaise. If hyponatraemia is severe or develops rapidly, it can cause convulsions, coma or death.<br>Factors that further increase the risk of hyponatraemia include:<br>Routine measurement of serum sodium concentration is not required, but may be considered 3 to 4 weeks after starting treatment in patients at high risk of hyponatraemia.<br>If hyponatraemia occurs, see here for assessment and management. Stopping the causative drug is usually required. If the causative drug is an SSRI, subsequent rechallenge with the same or a different SSRI may be possible without recurrence of hyponatraemia."

QT-interval prolongation is more likely with intravenous administration (eg for an acute behavioural disturbance). To determine whether an antipsychotic is likely to prolong the QT interval, see Table 8.31 for approximate relative frequencies and the Arizona CERT website.<br>Because of the potential for QT-interval prolongation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended before starting an antipsychotic, unless therapy is expected to be short term (eg shorter than 24 hours). If it is not possible to perform an ECG before starting an antipsychotic in a patient with acute symptoms, perform an ECG as soon as practical. If the patient is at risk of developing prolonged QT interval, repeat ECG once the antipsychotic has reached steady state (usually after 3 to 5 half-lives of the drug). Risk factors for QT-interval prolongation include [Note 8]:<br>For information on assessing QTc interval, see here.<br>If the baseline QTc interval is longer than 500 milliseconds:<br>During antipsychotic therapy, if QTc interval becomes longer than 500 milliseconds or lengthens by more than 60 milliseconds, address modifiable risk factors (as above) and:<br>If a patient develops torsades de pointes, see here for advice.<br><br>Sedation caused by antipsychotics<br>For advice on monitoring for and preventing antipsychotic adverse effects, see Overview of antipsychotic adverse effects.<br>Sedation is associated with all antipsychotics at high doses.

Warn the patient about sedation and associated risks (eg effect on ability to drive and operate machinery safely)—reassure them that sedation usually reduces after 1 to 2 weeks. If unacceptable sedation continues beyond this time, consider changing the administration time or, if possible, reducing the antipsychotic dose. If this is ineffective or impractical, switch to a less-sedating antipsychotic—see Table 8.31."
approach-acute-behavioural-disturbance,"Overview of acute behavioural disturbance<br>This topic focuses on management strategies used for people of all ages with acute behavioural disturbance; these strategies are context-dependent, and much nuance is required for every individual.<br>For the management of acute agitation and altered mental state in palliative care, see the specific topic here.<br>There is variation in the management approach taken for acute behavioural disturbance across different age groups and settings (including emergency departments, general hospital wards, general practice clinics, other outpatient clinics or the person’s home)—refer to local protocols or consensus state guidelines if they are available. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others. If it is safe to do so, align management with the patient’s preferences.<br>Managing threatening or aggressive behaviour is challenging. Threatening or aggressive behaviour is an expression of an underlying problem or unmet need that requires management. This type of behaviour is a function of distress that should prompt the clinician to explore potential predisposing factors (eg physical, psychological, social, environmental factors). Often multiple factors can precipitate an acute behavioural disturbance (see Table 8.2) and multiple modes of intervention are necessary.<br>If a person presents with acute severe behavioural disturbance, they require urgent care and support to address the underlying issue, and the situation needs to be de-escalated immediately, particularly if there is an:<br>The management of acute behavioural disturbance is contextual, governed by:<br>Initial management steps are often undertaken simultaneously and cyclically, with assessment occurring throughout. Interventions vary depending on whether the patient’s presentation is differentiated (ie known medical or psychiatric history) or undifferentiated. Align intervenitons with the patient’s preferences, if it is safe to do so. Steps include:<br>Monitor the patient closely according to local protocols or consensus state guidelines—see Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance. If indicated, facilitate transport or transfer to an appropriate treatment setting and ensure they are comprehensively followed-up as soon as possible.<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with an acute behavioural disturbance.<br><br>Principles of care for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance<br>The approach to assessing and managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance varies according to individual patient factors, the risk of significant harm to self or others, and the setting. The principles of care must uphold the human rights of the person as well as prevent harm—see Box 8.5 for principles of care for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>Any healthcare professional involved in managing patients with acute behavioural disturbance must be trained in the safe and effective delivery of both nonpharmacological management and pharmacological management. Best practice is supported by a standardised multidisciplinary approach with governance. If possible, refer to local protocols and consensus state guidelines, and seek expert advice to assist in managing difficult cases. Legal requirements for management of acute behavioural disturbance must also be met.<br>If the patient requires immediate intervention because of an imminent threat of harm to self or others, the principle of ‘duty of care’ may be used as a rationale for medical intervention without obtaining consent. If in doubt, consider the likely consequences of not intervening. Seek expert advice from a senior colleague whenever possible. Intervening without consent may be regarded as assault; however, many patients do not have the capacity to consent to treatment in these situations (eg children, people with developmental disability or cognitive impairment, alcohol- or drug-affected people). If it is safe to do so, discuss the patient’s distress and behaviour, and management options, with them and/or their carer, guardian or substitute decision maker. For more detailed information, see:<br>Any form of restrictive practice (eg pharmacological management, physical or mechanical restraint) should only be used as a last resort, and reserved for patients whose behaviour poses an imminent risk of significant harm to self or others.<br>Restrictive practices are discouraged in all people, particularly children, older people, and people with developmental disability or cognitive impairment. If restrictive practices are required, they must be proportionate to the risk of harm, and be employed for the minimum duration that ensures the safety of the person and others; see here for more information.<br>Careful documentation of care for a person with acute behavioural disturbance is essential—at a minimum, record:<br><br>Determining the safety of intervening in acute behavioural disturbance<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>The approach to assessing and managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance varies according to individual patient factors, the risk of significant harm to self or others, and the setting.<br>In adults, particular behaviours are suggestive of imminent significant harm; see Box 8.6.<br>To direct management, it is important to establish early whether the patient’s behaviour:<br>A Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT) score can assist clinical decision making in an acute behavioural disturbance. It can be used to assess the imminent risk of significant harm to self and others and guide the clinician as to whether repeat doses of sedative drugs are required. Consider the SAT score in the context of the situation and the individual—see Table 8.1.<br>The SAT has been validated in adults to assess the efficacy of pharmacological management in acute behavioural disturbance and guide the requirement for repeat doses of sedative drugs. Individualise the target SAT score based on patient factors (eg response to nonpharmacological interventions, whether the patient needs to be sedated for investigations) and the ability to maintain patient and staff safety.<br>The SAT has not been validated for use in children and older people, but has been used in trials to assess the effect of sedation in acute behavioural disturbance in these groups.<br>In adults, a SAT score of +2 or +3, may indicate an imminent risk of significant harm and immediate intervention is indicated. In children, older people, and people with a developmental disability or cognitive impairment, measure the SAT score once the environment and their unmet needs are optimised (eg the patient is in a quiet space, attempts have been made to address hunger, thirst, pain and toileting). Consider the SAT score in the context of the patient’s baseline function and communication style (eg loud outbursts may be usual for individuals with dementia or a developmental disability).

Security staff are less often required or involved when managing a child compared to an adult. Tailor the approach to the individual—a noncoercive approach, where the patient feels safe, promotes de-escalation and reduces the risk of trauma.<br>Isolated practitioners, including general practitioners or community nurses, should not attempt to manage a patient with an acute behavioural disturbance when they are alone in the community (eg in the patient’s home). Seek help from an ambulance service and/or police and if possible, ensure personal safety by moving to a safe environment.<br><br>Reducing the risk of harm in acute behavioural disturbance<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>Always take steps to ensure the safety of the patient (eg self-harm, unrecognised systemic illness, iatrogenic complications) and others (eg aggression or significant harm to staff or others present).<br>Use environmental management (or adaption) and verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention as first-line strategies for all patients with acute behavioural disturbance, unless there is an imminent risk of significant harm to self or others, and/or an immediate risk to life. These measures can help to defuse the situation, instil trust between the clinician and the patient, and avoid more invasive interventions. If the patient does not respond to these initial strategies, rapid intervention may be required before a comprehensive assessment is possible.<br>To reduce a patient’s distress and risk of harm to self or others:<br>The optimal approach depends on the patient and the clinician. If the patient has an existing behavioural support plan [Note 1], use it to guide management and try to involve usual carers or family if available. Discussing the patient’s preferences for the management of acute behavioural disturbance in advance can help de-escalation during an event.<br>If police have brought an adult to a health care facility handcuffed because of their behaviour, urgently assess the person while they remain handcuffed with police in attendance. After the initial assessment, if it is safe to do so, police may remove the handcuffs. If it is unsafe, pharmacological management may be required before police can safely remove the handcuffs. Children and people with developmental disability should never be handcuffed.<br>To minimise the imminent risk of significant harm to self and others, all patients with acute behavioural disturbance require close observation (eg continuous visual surveillance, very frequent observations). The Department of Health Mental health triage tool is a guide for assessing the severity of disturbance and risk of harm. <br>Transporting or transferring a patient between facilities is associated with risks to the patient and healthcare staff. Consider whether the benefit outweighs the potential harms (eg transferring a patient with dementia from a familiar care environment to an acute care facility may escalate their distress). See Transporting or transferring a patient before or after management of acute behavioural disturbance.<br><br>Assessing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>Only perform a comprehensive assessment when it is safe to do so; see Determining the safety of intervening in acute behavioural disturbance.<br>As a priority, assess and manage any life-threatening conditions—in children, life-threatening medical conditions rarely cause acute behavioural disturbance. In older people, acute behavioural disturbance is often due to delirium, which may be the only warning sign of significant deterioration and ought to be treated as a medical emergency.<br>The approach to assessing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance will depend on whether the behavioural disturbance is differentiated (ie there are known predisposing or precipitating factors contributing, such as a medical or psychiatric disorder) or undifferentiated. In children, a history can often be obtained from their accompanying parent or carer. In people with developmental disability, detailed guidance on assessing challenging behaviour is included here. An older patient may have delirium or a history of dementia that will help to guide management. If the patient has an existing behavioural support plan [Note 2], use it to guide management and try to involve usual carers or family if available.<br>Assessing a patient with an undifferentiated acute behavioural disturbance involves:<br>If it is safe to perform a comprehensive assessment, establish any potential precipitating and predisposing factors that may be contributing to the disturbance.

The aim of pharmacological management is to safely calm, soothe or sedate the patient in order to manage any precipitating or predisposing factors contributing to the acute behavioural disturbance. Pharmacological management is a restrictive practice that is sometimes referred to as ‘chemical restraint’. Nonpharmacological management techniques are preferred for first-line management of acute behavioural disturbance and should continue alongside any pharmacological regimen, both before and after drug administration; however, if there is an imminent risk of significant harm to the patient or others, immediate sedation may be required.<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance. Use the least restrictive intervention necessary to ensure the safety of the patient, staff and others. For detailed discussion and recommendations on pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in specific groups of patients, see the individual topics:<br><br>Principles of monitoring patients with acute behavioural disturbance<br>Figure 8.1 is a detailed flowchart for managing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>After administering any sedative drug to a patient with acute behavioural disturbance, always monitor them closely to assess the efficacy of interventions and to identify potential harms. Refer to local protocols or consensus state guidelines if they are available. Observe all patients administered a sedative drug with 1:1 continuous visual nursing observation for adverse effects of drugs. Once it is clear they are not oversedated and can maintain a patent airway, intermittent monitoring is sufficient; specify the frequency of nursing observations and medical reviews clearly. Each patient is different and monitoring schedules must be flexible (eg older people who have been administered sedation are at increased risk of falls and require continuous visual monitoring).<br>The Joint College’s Guidelines for Safe Care for Patients Sedated in Health Care Facilities for Acute Behavioural Disturbance recommend the following minimum monitoring and equipment requirements for a patient who has been administered any sedative drug:<br>Minimum monitoring and equipment requirements for managing patients after parenteral sedation are:<br>In community settings (especially in rural and remote areas) if the minimum monitoring and equipment requirements are not available, a senior clinician needs to make a risk assessment about the relative risk of the situation proportionate to the risk of the sedative drug.<br>Tailor monitoring depending on the:<br>When monitoring the patient, provide a calm and quiet environment, and minimise unnecessary stimulation or irritation; however, balance this with the need to carry out required observations to detect complications and intervene quickly if they arise.<br><br>Transporting or transferring a patient before or after management of acute behavioural disturbance<br>Transporting or transferring a patient with acute behavioural disturbance is complex and involves multiple risks, including risk to the patient, risk to healthcare staff, and risk associated with the transfer or transport itself. Consider whether the benefit of transporting or transferring the patient outweighs the potential harms (eg transferring a patient with dementia from a familiar care environment to an acute care facility may escalate their distress). Ensure the safety of both the patient and healthcare staff (see Reducing the risk of harm). Summon adequate support early if necessary (eg ambulance, security staff, police).<br>For a patient who retains decision-making capacity, transport cannot proceed without their consent. If the patient lacks capacity to consent, compliance with relevant legislation is imperative (see Principles of care for a patient with acute behavioural disturbance). Ensure a record of the patient’s observations, drug administration and physical restraint, and required legal documentation, accompany the patient in transport.<br>Before initiating transport or transfer, ensure that any precipitating or predisposing factors that could be contributing to the patient’s acute behavioural disturbance are addressed (eg hunger, thirst, hypoglycaemia, pain, urinary retention, sepsis or trauma). Arrange appropriate transport (eg police vehicle, ambulance), considering the duration of the trip and potential delays. Also arrange supervision or a medical escort, informed by the patient’s clinical requirements (eg potential requirement for further sedation). If the patient has been administered sedation, a clinician who can manage airway compromise and respiratory depression en route should escort the patient. Resuscitation equipment and continuous monitoring of vital signs must be available.<br>If an adult patient has been mechanically restrained, reconsider the need for ongoing restraint; if it is essential, provide a suitable means of safe restraint en route. Restraint must be proportionate to the risk of harm, and only be employed for the minimum duration that ensures the safety of the patient and others; see Mechanical restraint.<br>If a long journey is expected, provide instructions for repeated sedative drug administration, if required. If a drug is required during transport, use a dose that maintains a safe level of sedation for the patient and healthcare staff.<br>In some cases, it may be necessary to enlist a specialist medical retrieval team to anaesthetise, intubate, and ventilate the patient for safe transport.<br><br>Follow-up<br>Following management of acute behavioural disturbance, the patient should be allowed to recover in a calm environment with regular monitoring. All patients require a comprehensive clinical assessment after they have recovered to identify the cause, assess management, and to prevent future events; see Assessing a patient with acute behavioural disturbance.<br>Ensure documentation of management is complete, including nonpharmacological and pharmacological management. If physical restraint was used, document the rationale for its use, the type of restraint used, the patient’s response, monitoring undertaken, the duration of restraint, and any adverse events.<br>Arrange appropriate medical or psychiatric follow-up, as required. If appropriate, discharge the patient into the care of a responsible adult, with written instructions about resumption of normal activities (eg driving). Sedative drugs can continue to cause significant cognitive impairment for several days following exposure. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery for at least 3 days after discharge or until review by their general practitioner.<br>Audit the assessment and management of acute behavioural disturbances for compliance with local protocols, to identify trends and prevent future adverse events."
attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder,"Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children<br>The core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Children with ADHD exhibit these symptoms with greater frequency and severity than other children at a comparable level of development. ADHD occurs in 5 to 7% of school-aged children. It is a chronic condition that can cause considerable disruption to the lives of children and their families or carers and has a major impact on educational outcomes. Accurate diagnosis and treatment with a comprehensive multimodal intervention using nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, as appropriate, can make a significant difference to the child and their family.<br>Children with ADHD commonly have comorbid psychiatric disorders and higher rates of developmental disability than other children.<br>Management of ADHD is multifaceted and an individualised multimodal management plan should be developed.

Use of a food diary can be beneficial to link symptoms to dietary exposures. Refer children in whom a link between certain foods and ADHD symptoms is observed to a dietitian for consideration of dietary modification.<br>Do not use dietary supplements (eg omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals) unless the child has a deficiency.<br>Give family or carers information about relevant support groups and community organisations where they can receive training about managing children with ADHD (see ADHD Australia).<br>Other resources that may be useful include:<br><br>Overview of pharmacotherapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children<br>Nonpharmacological management is first line for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Pharmacotherapy may be added, depending on the child’s age, as part of an individualised, multimodal management plan. The plan should outline the treatment approach and developmental goals. Pharmacotherapy should be prescribed by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children—follow the principles of psychotropic use in children.<br>Because of the adverse effects associated with drugs used to treat ADHD in children, take baseline measurements, such as height, weight, heart rate and blood pressure before starting pharmacotherapy (see also Monitoring during drug treatment of ADHD).<br>Stimulants are first-line drugs for the treatment of ADHD in children.<br>Atomoxetine may be used if a stimulant cannot be used, is not tolerated, when there is comorbid Tourette syndrome or a severe anxiety disorder, or there is a risk of misuse of stimulants (either by the child or the adult supporting the child).<br>Guanfacine is usually reserved for children with ADHD who do not tolerate stimulants, or as an adjunct to a stimulant in children who have had an inadequate response. Guanfacine is also useful in children with a comorbid tic disorder (eg Tourette syndrome).<br>Clonidine has a similar role to guanfacine but its use is limited by its short half-life, which necessitates multiple-daily dosing.<br>The optimal duration of pharmacotherapy for ADHD is unclear—review the need for ongoing treatment in children at least once a year (see Duration of pharmacotherapy for ADHD).<br><br>Stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children<br>Stimulants (dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate) are first-line drugs for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children.

For newly diagnosed patients or those entering residential aged-care facilities, undertake a comprehensive assessment. This includes:<br>For advice on the regular care of a patient with dementia, see Table 8.7.<br>The common causes of dementia are Alzheimer disease (50 to 75% of cases), vascular dementia (20 to 30%), frontotemporal dementias (up to 10%), and dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia (up to 10%). Many patients have more than one subtype of dementia (mixed dementia); the most common combination is Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Less common causes include infections (eg human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), hazardous alcohol consumption (a significant cause of dementia arising before the age of 65), Huntington disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and traumatic brain injury.<br>Dementia subtypes are diagnosed on the basis of early clinical features, patterns of disease progression, and behavioural and psychological features. These diagnoses are probable rather than definite because clinical features of a specific pathology widely vary—cerebral imaging can assist with diagnosis. If possible, seek diagnostic advice from a specialist if a dementia subtype other than Alzheimer disease is suspected. Box 8.25 lists typical features of common dementia subtypes.<br>Memory impairment is prominent early in Alzheimer dementia. As dementia slowly progresses, memory declines further and other symptoms become more prominent, including executive function impairment [NB3].<br>In dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, memory is often initially maintained but deteriorates as dementia slowly progresses. Both dementias are associated with impaired executive function [NB3] and have a gradual, progressive decline with visual hallucinations, fluctuations in arousal and attention, or parkinsonism. REM sleep behaviour disorder often precedes both dementias.<br>Although features, onset and progression of frontotemporal dementia vary, memory often only deteriorates as dementia progresses. Prominent early symptoms include personality and behavioural changes, and language problems.<br>Vascular dementia can have a sudden onset (following stroke) or manifest with progressive or stepwise cognitive decline. Symptomatology depends on the nature and location of cerebrovascular disease, but impaired executive function is common [NB3].<br>The Mini-mental State Examination [MMSE] and Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE]) are moderately correlated with functional impairment in Alzheimer disease and have been used to assess its severity in drug trials. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) uses these tests to determine Alzheimer disease severity. A MMSE score between 21 and 24 (out of 30) is generally accepted to indicate mild Alzheimer disease, a score between 10 and 20 indicates moderate Alzheimer disease and a score less than 10 indicates severe Alzheimer disease.<br>The MMSE and SMMSE have limited real-world applications. Some patients (eg those with intellectual disabilities, poor education level, illiteracy, innumeracy, sensory impairments, or those from linguistically or culturally diverse backgrounds) may be unable to take these tests or record a misleadingly low result. Although the MMSE and SMMSE are suitable to assess Alzheimer disease, they are not suitable to assess most other types of dementia because they primarily assess cognition (executive function is not adequately tested).<br>In practice, dementia severity is based on the impact of functional and cognitive impairment, behavioural and psychological symptoms, and previous cognitive functioning. For example, a person with early frontotemporal dementia who has limited cognitive impairment (eg a MMSE score of 24) but significant behavioural problems necessitating institutional care would be considered to have severe dementia. Whereas, a patient with early Alzheimer disease who has limited education may appear to have significant cognitive impairment on testing (eg a MMSE score of 13), but may not be functionally impaired and would be considered to have mild dementia.<br>Over 90% of patients with dementia will experience behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms can have a significant effect on the patient and their family, carers or significant others, and precipitate entry into residential aged care—see Box 8.26 for examples of BPSD.<br>Delusions—distressing beliefs [NB1]<br>Hallucinations [NB1]<br>Agitation—easily upset, repeating questions, arguing or complaining, hoarding, pacing, inappropriate screaming, crying out or disruptive sounds, rejection of care (eg bathing, dressing, grooming), leaving home<br>Aggression—physical or verbal<br>Depression or dysphoria<br>Anxiety—worrying, shadowing (ie following carer)<br>Apathy or indifference<br>Disinhibition—socially or sexually inappropriate behaviour<br>Irritability or lability<br>Motor disturbance—repetitive activities without purpose (eg wandering, rummaging)<br>Night-time behaviours—waking and getting up at night<br>Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are multifactorial, often arising or worsening as dementia progresses and the patient loses the ability to communicate. Before starting treatment for a behavioural and psychological symptom of dementia, address factors that could precipitate the behaviour, see Box 8.27.<br>Try to understand the behaviour in the context of the patient’s life story (including cultural, religious or social norms) and personality—seek information from people familiar with the patient before and while affected by dementia.<br>Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are often temporary.

Less common causes include infections (eg human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), hazardous alcohol consumption (a significant cause of dementia arising before the age of 65), Huntington disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and traumatic brain injury.<br>Dementia subtypes are diagnosed on the basis of early clinical features, patterns of disease progression, and behavioural and psychological features. These diagnoses are probable rather than definite because clinical features of a specific pathology widely vary—cerebral imaging can assist with diagnosis. If possible, seek diagnostic advice from a specialist if a dementia subtype other than Alzheimer disease is suspected. Box 8.25 lists typical features of common dementia subtypes.<br>Memory impairment is prominent early in Alzheimer dementia. As dementia slowly progresses, memory declines further and other symptoms become more prominent, including executive function impairment [NB3].<br>In dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, memory is often initially maintained but deteriorates as dementia slowly progresses. Both dementias are associated with impaired executive function [NB3] and have a gradual, progressive decline with visual hallucinations, fluctuations in arousal and attention, or parkinsonism. REM sleep behaviour disorder often precedes both dementias.<br>Although features, onset and progression of frontotemporal dementia vary, memory often only deteriorates as dementia progresses. Prominent early symptoms include personality and behavioural changes, and language problems.<br>Vascular dementia can have a sudden onset (following stroke) or manifest with progressive or stepwise cognitive decline. Symptomatology depends on the nature and location of cerebrovascular disease, but impaired executive function is common [NB3].<br><br>The Mini-mental State Examination [MMSE] and Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE]) are moderately correlated with functional impairment in Alzheimer disease and have been used to assess its severity in drug trials. The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) uses these tests to determine Alzheimer disease severity. A MMSE score between 21 and 24 (out of 30) is generally accepted to indicate mild Alzheimer disease, a score between 10 and 20 indicates moderate Alzheimer disease and a score less than 10 indicates severe Alzheimer disease.<br>The MMSE and SMMSE have limited real-world applications. Some patients (eg those with intellectual disabilities, poor education level, illiteracy, innumeracy, sensory impairments, or those from linguistically or culturally diverse backgrounds) may be unable to take these tests or record a misleadingly low result. Although the MMSE and SMMSE are suitable to assess Alzheimer disease, they are not suitable to assess most other types of dementia because they primarily assess cognition (executive function is not adequately tested).<br>In practice, dementia severity is based on the impact of functional and cognitive impairment, behavioural and psychological symptoms, and previous cognitive functioning. For example, a person with early frontotemporal dementia who has limited cognitive impairment (eg a MMSE score of 24) but significant behavioural problems necessitating institutional care would be considered to have severe dementia. Whereas, a patient with early Alzheimer disease who has limited education may appear to have significant cognitive impairment on testing (eg a MMSE score of 13), but may not be functionally impaired and would be considered to have mild dementia.<br><br>Over 90% of patients with dementia will experience behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms can have a significant effect on the patient and their family, carers or significant others, and precipitate entry into residential aged care—see Box 8.26 for examples of BPSD.<br>Delusions—distressing beliefs [NB1]<br>Hallucinations [NB1]<br>Agitation—easily upset, repeating questions, arguing or complaining, hoarding, pacing, inappropriate screaming, crying out or disruptive sounds, rejection of care (eg bathing, dressing, grooming), leaving home<br>Aggression—physical or verbal<br>Depression or dysphoria<br>Anxiety—worrying, shadowing (ie following carer)<br>Apathy or indifference<br>Disinhibition—socially or sexually inappropriate behaviour<br>Irritability or lability<br>Motor disturbance—repetitive activities without purpose (eg wandering, rummaging)<br>Night-time behaviours—waking and getting up at night<br>Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are multifactorial, often arising or worsening as dementia progresses and the patient loses the ability to communicate.

Communication abilities often decline as dementia progresses, and changed or challenging behaviour is often caused by unmet needs unlikely to be helped by drugs (eg need to toilet, distress from pain or loneliness, frustration). If behaviour is adequately assessed and its cause is promptly addressed, drugs are unnecessary for most patients with dementia who experience symptoms of agitation, aggression or psychosis.<br>Drugs used to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia appear to be less effective than nonpharmacological management. These limitations must be balanced against the serious harms associated with psychotropic use in people with dementia. Only consider using a drug to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia if nonpharmacological management has not alleviated symptoms and the patient is distressed or considered a threat to themselves or others. It is preferable to seek expert advice (eg from a specialist or a specialist centre [Note 9]) before starting a drug.<br>If a drug is used for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia:<br>If a drug appears to be ineffective, reassess behavioural and psychological symptoms and consider seeking expert advice—do not continue to trial drugs to manage the behaviour.<br>The evidence base to guide drug use for behavioural symptoms of dementia is mainly from common dementia subtypes (Alzheimer disease, mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, and to a lesser extent, dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia in Parkinson disease). Use caution before applying the advice below to other dementias (eg frontotemporal dementia).<br>Antipsychotics are the drug class of choice for agitation, aggression or psychotic symptoms of Alzheimer disease and mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia because they have the strongest evidence (although small) of benefit. Risperidone, olanzapine and, to a lesser extent, aripiprazole can modestly reduce these symptoms in a small proportion of patients. This modest efficacy must be balanced with a range of adverse effects, including further cognitive decline and an increased risk of death and cerebrovascular events. If the patient is at high risk of stroke (eg has poorly controlled vascular disease, atrial fibrillation or a history of stroke), avoid using an antipsychotic; undertake a benefit–harm analysis and if possible, seek expert advice.<br>For advice on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson disease, see here.<br>Patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies can experience severe sensitivity reactions and worsening of motor symptoms in response to antipsychotics. The drugs of choice for agitation, aggression or psychosis in these patients are rivastigmine or donepezil. There is insufficient evidence to guide antipsychotic therapy in dementia with Lewy bodies—use antipsychotic therapy with caution. If antipsychotic therapy is used, low-dose quetiapine is preferred because it may be less likely to cause the aforementioned adverse effects.<br>If an antipsychotic cannot be used or has been ineffective, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant may be considered for agitation or aggression (not psychosis) of dementia. However, the evidence base to support SSRIs for agitation and aggression of dementia is significantly weaker than for antipsychotics. Although antidepressants appear to be safer than antipsychotics (they are associated with significantly lower mortality rates), they are associated with other adverse effects including hyponatraemia and falls. Of all the SSRIs, citalopram has the strongest evidence for agitation and aggression of dementia—if it is used, monitor for adverse effects and review response to treatment at 2 to 3 months and consider stopping if effectiveness is limited.<br>Avoid using benzodiazepines to treat agitation, aggression and psychosis of dementia—there is limited evidence of benefit and they are associated with serious adverse effects including cognitive decline, urinary incontinence, falls, hip fractures and dependence [Note 10]. Benzodiazepine use has also been associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Communication abilities often decline as dementia progresses, and changed or challenging behaviour is often caused by unmet needs unlikely to be helped by drugs (eg need to toilet, distress from pain or loneliness, frustration). If behaviour is adequately assessed and its cause is promptly addressed, drugs are unnecessary for most patients with dementia who experience symptoms of agitation, aggression or psychosis.<br>Drugs used to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia appear to be less effective than nonpharmacological management. These limitations must be balanced against the serious harms associated with psychotropic use in people with dementia. Only consider using a drug to treat agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia if nonpharmacological management has not alleviated symptoms and the patient is distressed or considered a threat to themselves or others. It is preferable to seek expert advice (eg from a specialist or a specialist centre [Note 9]) before starting a drug.<br>If a drug is used for agitation, aggression or psychosis of dementia:<br>If a drug appears to be ineffective, reassess behavioural and psychological symptoms and consider seeking expert advice—do not continue to trial drugs to manage the behaviour.<br>The evidence base to guide drug use for behavioural symptoms of dementia is mainly from common dementia subtypes (Alzheimer disease, mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, and to a lesser extent, dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia in Parkinson disease). Use caution before applying the advice below to other dementias (eg frontotemporal dementia).<br>Antipsychotics are the drug class of choice for agitation, aggression or psychotic symptoms of Alzheimer disease and mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia because they have the strongest evidence (although small) of benefit. Risperidone, olanzapine and, to a lesser extent, aripiprazole can modestly reduce these symptoms in a small proportion of patients. This modest efficacy must be balanced with a range of adverse effects, including further cognitive decline and an increased risk of death and cerebrovascular events. If the patient is at high risk of stroke (eg has poorly controlled vascular disease, atrial fibrillation or a history of stroke), avoid using an antipsychotic; undertake a benefit–harm analysis and if possible, seek expert advice.<br>For advice on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson disease, see here.<br>Patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies can experience severe sensitivity reactions and worsening of motor symptoms in response to antipsychotics. The drugs of choice for agitation, aggression or psychosis in these patients are rivastigmine or donepezil. There is insufficient evidence to guide antipsychotic therapy in dementia with Lewy bodies—use antipsychotic therapy with caution. If antipsychotic therapy is used, low-dose quetiapine is preferred because it may be less likely to cause the aforementioned adverse effects.<br>If an antipsychotic cannot be used or has been ineffective, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant may be considered for agitation or aggression (not psychosis) of dementia. However, the evidence base to support SSRIs for agitation and aggression of dementia is significantly weaker than for antipsychotics. Although antidepressants appear to be safer than antipsychotics (they are associated with significantly lower mortality rates), they are associated with other adverse effects including hyponatraemia and falls. Of all the SSRIs, citalopram has the strongest evidence for agitation and aggression of dementia—if it is used, monitor for adverse effects and review response to treatment at 2 to 3 months and consider stopping if effectiveness is limited.<br>Avoid using benzodiazepines to treat agitation, aggression and psychosis of dementia—there is limited evidence of benefit and they are associated with serious adverse effects including cognitive decline, urinary incontinence, falls, hip fractures and dependence [Note 10].

depressive-episodes-bipolar-disorder,"Principles of managing bipolar depression in adults and young people<br>For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of depression, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.<br>In order to recognise a depressive episode as bipolar depression, a previous episode of mania or hypomania must have occurred (see Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in adults and young people). Refer patients with bipolar depression to a psychiatrist, a mental health service or an acute mental health facility but do not delay treatment if prompt review is not available.<br>A safety assessment determines the most appropriate treatment setting. It is crucial to assess the risk of suicide in patients with bipolar depression because most suicide attempts occur during a depressive episode. Also assess the severity of depression, level of functional impairment, ability to adhere to treatments and availability of psychosocial supports. Bipolar depression is usually managed by a psychiatrist, with care delivered by a community mental health team, a shared-care program with the general practitioner, or an outpatient program. Patients with severe symptoms of bipolar depression who are a danger to themselves or others require urgent treatment in hospital [Note 1]. Patients with depressive stupor need urgent psychiatric referral.<br>The primary aim of treatment is to alleviate depressive symptoms and restore functional capacity. Pharmacotherapy is usually required for bipolar depression (unless the episode is very mild or self-limiting). Drug choice is influenced by current or previous pharmacotherapy and response, the safety and tolerability of the drug, and clinical features. See Pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression for more detail and drug regimens. Continue treatment for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.<br>While pharmacotherapy is usually required for bipolar depression, psychological interventions can be used adjunctively. Start psychological interventions during an acute bipolar depressive episode, if possible, or soon afterwards when the patient may be more able to engage with treatment. Effective interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal and social rhythm therapy and family-focused therapy. These interventions can result in a more rapid recovery and improved functioning. Continue psychosocial interventions after the acute depressive episode has settled, as they can help to prevent relapse and restore quality of life—see Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder in adults and young people.<br>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is reserved for acutely depressed patients or urgent situations (eg depressive stupor, psychotic symptoms, substantive suicidal thoughts).<br>Optimised multimodal therapy and an adequate duration of drug therapy can prevent recurrent episodes, which are associated with worse long-term outcomes. Poor treatment adherence can lead to relapse or recurrent episodes; check blood drug concentrations where relevant [Note 2][Note 3]. Other common causes of recurrence or relapse include substance abuse, stressful life events or sleep issues. If relapse occurs, treat according to the mood episode and consider the need for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, in consultation with the patient’s psychiatrist.<br>See also the additional considerations:<br><br>Overview of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression in adults and young people<br>See Principles of managing bipolar depression in adults and young people for advice on the setting in which initial treatment should be delivered, the requirement for psychiatrist oversight and an overview of management.<br>Consider whether this is the first presentation of bipolar depression or if the patient is currently receiving treatment for bipolar depression and is relapsing or not responding.

ECT is administered under general anaesthesia and patients are also given a short-acting muscle relaxant before the procedure.<br>ECT can be used for severe psychiatric disorders, including in patients who have:<br>Most Australian states and territories have ECT legislation that details:<br>The stigma and anxiety associated with ECT can be a barrier to both clinicians and patients choosing this therapy. However, advances in technique and administration provide an improved balance between the benefits and harms of ECT.<br>Treatment approach is individualised to the patient, their disorder and their response to ECT. Individualisation can be achieved through adjustment of ECT parameters, such as current delivered, electrode placement, frequency of treatment. A course of ECT typically consists of multiple sessions, usually administered 2 to 3 times a week. Relapse rates after ECT are high and recovery should be maintained with pharmacotherapy. Occasionally, maintenance ECT is used for patients who do not respond to maintenance pharmacotherapy.<br>For advice on ECT during pregnancy, see here.<br><br>Adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy<br>Common adverse effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) include muscle pain (associated with the muscle relaxant used before the procedure), headaches and transient confusion (lasting for approximately one hour after treatment).<br>Many patients have difficulty forming new memories during a treatment course of ECT; they may also already have cognitive impairments due to their underlying disorder. After the course of ECT, memory impairment generally returns to normal; memory may be improved during remission compared to pretreatment functioning. A small proportion of patients experience prolonged confusion or impairment in recall of remote autobiographical memories after a course of ECT. In general, both intra- and post-treatment memory problems are less with unilateral than bilateral ECT, and particularly less with ultra–brief current ECT.<br><br>Electroconvulsive therapy and concurrent psychotropic use<br>A plan for managing psychotropics during and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) should be developed by the patient’s psychiatrist in collaboration with the psychiatrist administering ECT. Some psychotropics may need to be stopped before ECT. The following information is included for reference only, for nonspecialists.<br>Benzodiazepines raise the seizure threshold and may impair the efficacy of ECT, and should be stopped before ECT.<br>There are limited benefits to continuing the patient’s antidepressant during ECT; some studies suggest that concurrent antidepressant use may increase the risk of adverse effects. Generally, all antidepressants should be stopped before administering ECT.<br>Although lithium does not impair the effectiveness of ECT, it may result in severe postictal confusion even at a low blood concentration. The treating psychiatrists should decide on the best approach to managing lithium during ECT.<br>Continuing an antiepileptic is likely to reduce the efficacy of ECT, prolong the course of ECT and impair cognition. In patients with epilepsy, antiepileptics should not usually be stopped because this increases the risk of seizures. In patients taking antiepileptics for the management of bipolar disorder, antiepileptics are ideally stopped before or early in the course of ECT. If required, antiepileptics can be restarted at the end of the course of ECT.<br>For psychoses, an antipsychotic should be continued unless clearly ineffective or adversely interacting with ECT (eg seizures related to clozapine use during ECT). Limited evidence suggests that outcomes when combining antipsychotics with ECT are better than for either treatment alone.<br><br>Electroconvulsive therapy during pregnancy<br>The stigma and anxiety associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be amplified during pregnancy; this can be a barrier to ECT for clinicians and patients. However, ECT is an important component of therapy for several psychiatric disorders. Failing to use ECT when indicated can increase the risk of harm to the patient and fetus, due to suicidality, impulsivity and self-neglect.<br>Although inadequate treatment of psychiatric disorders is associated with adverse outcomes for the patient and fetus, ECT can also cause adverse effects. In addition to its usual adverse effects, ECT during pregnancy can cause mild vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, transient benign fetal arrhythmias, uterine contractions (mostly transient) and preterm delivery. Some case reports and series describe relatively high rates of fetal adverse events (up to 29%); however, safety data are limited and there are insufficient high-quality data to determine a causal link with ECT.<br>ECT is an option if a pregnant patient usually takes a teratogenic psychotropic (eg sodium valproate) and alternative treatments cannot be used.<br>To prepare a pregnant patient for ECT, follow the same process as for nonpregnant patients, but also consult with the patient’s obstetrician—ECT should be used with caution if the patient has a condition that could lead to placental compromise (eg hypertension, diabetes). The anaesthetic care for pregnant patients undergoing ECT should be undertaken by an anaesthetist with expertise in ECT in pregnancy. Fetal cardiotocographic monitoring is required before, during and after ECT."

grief,"Grief<br>For information about grief in the palliative care setting, see Loss, grief and bereavement.<br>Grief is a normal response after a significant loss (eg death of a spouse, loss of employment, loss of independence), severe illness or personal injury. It presents with thoughts and feelings of emptiness and loss, and may be accompanied by a wide variety of symptoms, including insomnia and sadness. Acute grief can be debilitating in the short term but is usually integrated over time, and the person is able to resume their day-to-day functioning. However, the loss of a spouse or loved one can be a trigger for a depressive episode; some of the symptoms may mimic major depression or another psychiatric disorder. Uncomplicated acute grief is not accompanied by feelings of worthlessness or strong suicidal thoughts, and improves with time. If the person has feelings of worthlessness or strong suicidal thoughts, assess for major depression or another depressive disorder (see Assessing a person with depressive symptoms and Assessing suicide risk).<br>Conventional supports (eg family, social, religious) are usually sufficient to help someone who is acutely grieving. Support from a clinician can also be helpful. There is a limited role for pharmacotherapy in acute grief. Anxiolytics or hypnotics may be trialled to alleviate excessive anxiety or insomnia for a brief period (fewer than 7 days)."
hoarding-disorder,"Hoarding disorder<br>Hoarding disorder is an obsessive compulsive–related disorder characterised by anxiety about discarding possessions, irrespective of their monetary value. This results in substantial accumulation of possessions and extreme clutter in the living environment. Patients’ insight varies, with some patients lacking insight or having delusional beliefs, which makes treatment challenging.<br>Hoarding disorder has poor prognosis and is poorly responsive to therapy. Psychosocial interventions are first line and should be administered by clinicians with expertise in treating hoarding disorder. Initial treatment includes psychoeducation.

The symptoms, last at least 4 consecutive days and are present for most of the day. It may be difficult to distinguish symptoms of hypomania from substance intoxication (eg stimulants) or early symptoms of a manic episode. If hypomania is suspected in a patient without a known history of bipolar disorder, refer to a psychiatrist or mental health team for assessment and confirmation of the diagnosis. In a patient with a known history of bipolar disorder, review the patient regularly to determine if their symptoms develop into acute mania.<br>Patients with bipolar disorder rarely seek treatment during a hypomanic episode because they usually do not recognise their thoughts, feelings or behaviours as unusual, and instead, may see the experience as positive and not indicative of illness. Symptoms of hypomania might be identified by significant others, family or carers.<br>Unlike acute mania, hypomania is self-limiting and not an emergency. In general, hypomania does not require acute treatment but may require adjustments to the patient’s treatment and use of psychosocial interventions; however, there is little evidence to guide treatment. If the patient is concerned by their symptoms, consider treating specific symptoms, such as:<br>Consider referral to a psychiatrist or community mental health team.<br>See also the additional considerations:<br><br>Principles of managing hypomania in children<br>For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of hypomania, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in children.<br>The principles of treating hypomania in children are similar to those in adults and young people; however, treatment should always be provided by a service with practitioners experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children."
informed-consent-shared-decision-making,"Informed consent for a person with a psychiatric disorder<br>Seek consent from the person before starting treatment for a psychiatric disorder. Issues for clinicians to consider when assessing consent to treatment in a person with a psychiatric disorder are outlined in Box 8.1.<br>For a person’s consent to be valid, it must be given without coercion and in accordance with the relevant local policies and legislation. The person must have adequate decision-making capacity to provide consent (ie ability to give informed consent to a particular decision at a particular time) and have been provided with adequate information to enable them to reach and communicate an informed decision about their treatment (see Shared decision making for a person with a psychiatric disorder). Even if the person lacks the capacity to provide informed consent, they should be involved in the process of consent. Equally, it is important to engage the person in treatment decisions, even if they are receiving involuntary treatment in accordance with relevant mental health legislation. When safe and feasible, a person’s treatment decisions should be supported even if they do not align with what is considered optimal care.<br>When people with psychiatric disorders have capacity to consent, they should be able to provide or withdraw consent to treatment freely and without coercion. If the person lacks the capacity to consent to certain treatments, they may still be able to provide consent on other matters.<br>If there are concerns about the person’s capacity to provide consent and a particular treatment is considered necessary, refer to the relevant State or Territory legislation for information on who can provide consent (see also Box 8.2). If urgent intervention is required and it is not possible to obtain consent, the principle of ‘duty of care’ may be used as a rationale for medical intervention without obtaining consent. If in doubt, consider the likely consequences of not intervening—consult a senior colleague whenever possible.<br>A person’s capacity to provide informed consent may fluctuate over time. Capacity to provide informed consent should be reviewed periodically and appropriate action taken to ensure that consent continues to be valid.<br><br>Shared decision making for a person with a psychiatric disorder<br>Shared decision making enables doctors and patients to make health decisions in partnership, informed by the best available evidence and the patient’s values and preferences.<br>Patients who take part in shared decision making have a more accurate understanding of the benefits and harms of the available treatment options.<br>A shared decision-making approach should be used when discussing treatment options for the patient’s psychiatric disorder. Shared decision making promotes engagement in the therapeutic process, empowerment and increased adherence to treatment decisions. The clinician’s role in the shared decision-making process is outlined in Box 8.3.<br>If a consumer wellness plan or similar advance care directive is available, this may also be used to assist in shared decision making. A consumer wellness plan (also referred to as a Wellness Recovery Action Plan) contains information about a patient’s choices and preferences for the ongoing care of their mental health, particularly in terms of symptom management, relapse prevention and crisis planning.<br>Treatment decision aids are used widely in other areas of medicine to facilitate shared decision making, but are not yet standard practice for psychiatric disorders [Note 1]."

Limited evidence suggests that complementary medicines (eg valerian, chamomile, hops, wuling, passionflower, kava) are no more effective than placebo for treating insomnia.

jet-lag,"Overview of jet lag<br>Jet lag is a temporary sleep disorder that commonly affects travellers who fly across several time zones. It is caused by a mismatch between the body’s circadian rhythm and the destination’s day–night cycle. Symptoms of jet lag include poor nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, malaise, cognitive impairment (eg reduced alertness and functioning) and gastrointestinal upset.<br>Jet lag is worsened by:<br>Typically, jet lag spontaneously resolves within a few days; however, it can be a serious impediment to professional performance and general functioning.<br><br>Interventions to prevent or reduce jet lag<br>Behavioural and pharmacological interventions may prevent or reduce jet lag.

Melatonin plays a central role in regulating circadian rhythms and can prevent or reduce jet lag in adults flying across 5 or more time zones, but may be useful if crossing more than 2 time zones. Immediate-release melatonin is not registered in Australia, but is available via the Special Access Scheme and from compounding pharmacies. To prevent or reduce jet lag in an adult, consider:<br>Avoid over-the-counter and internet-sourced melatonin formulations because the melatonin content in these preparations is unreliable. Although modified-release melatonin is registered in Australia for insomnia in adults aged 55 years or older, it is relatively ineffective for jetlag. If a suitable immediate-release melatonin formulation is not available, the modified-release formulation, taken 60 to 120 minutes on the plane before bedtime of the final destination and continued for up to 3 subsequent nights may be considered.<br>Avoid combining melatonin with other sedating drugs (eg hypnotics) to aid sleep; the benefits of this practice are unclear and it may cause further sedation.<br>Limited evidence suggests that hypnotics may reduce jet lag–related insomnia in adults; however, unlike melatonin, hypnotics do not help circadian phase shift. The modest potential benefits of hypnotics may be outweighed by their significant adverse effects including amnesia, confusion, dangerous sleep-related behaviours and risk of dependence. Hypnotic induced-immobility on the plane may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (ie deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE])—see below for further advice. If an adult wishes to take a hypnotic for acute insomnia associated with jet lag, assess the risk of misuse and discuss the limitations and harms of the hypnotic with them. Also advise the adult to avoid alcohol and other sedating drugs because combining a hypnotic with other sedatives increases the risk of central nervous system adverse effects.<br>If after discussing the potential benefits, harms and limitations of using a hypnotic for insomnia associated with jet lag, an adult wishes to take a hypnotic, consider zolpidem, zopiclone or temazepam. The regimens below are ranked in order of the quality and quantity of data to support their use in jet lag and their elimination half-lives—because of the limited opportunity to sleep on a flight, hypnotics with a quick onset of action and short half-life are preferred. Temazepam has the longest half-life and poorer quality data to support its use in jet lag. A suitable regimen is:<br>Immobility associated with hypnotics (or potentially, melatonin at high doses) may increase the risk of VTE. If a person at high risk of VTE wishes to take a hypnotic, they should not start it on the flight and instead start it on the first night at the final destination.

major-depression,"Features of major depression<br>People with major depression typically have a low mood, loss of interest and enjoyment in activities, and other psychological and somatic symptoms. Other symptoms of major depression include:<br>In children, irritability may be a prominent symptom. Older people with depression may report atypical symptoms, including more physical symptoms and less sadness compared to younger people, although evidence is inconclusive. Psychotic symptoms, melancholic features (see below), insomnia, hypochondriasis and subjective memory complaints may also be more common in older people.<br>Major depression is diagnosed if a patient has at least 5 depressive symptoms for at least 2 weeks; and at least 1 of the symptoms is either depressed mood, or loss of interest or pleasure in activities.<br>Depressive symptoms are a feature of many disorders.

Patients tend to experience loss of pleasure in all or almost all activities, marked weight loss, a lack of reactivity of mood, and psychomotor retardation or agitation.<br><br>Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people<br>Manage major depression in adults and young people with psychosocial interventions and, when required, drug treatment. For the approach to treating depression in people with dementia, see here.<br>At the time that depression is diagnosed, provide psychoeducation to the patient: discuss the diagnosis (including its natural history with and without treatment) with the patient and, if appropriate, their family, carers or significant others; identify acute or chronic stressors that can be addressed with psychosocial interventions; and explain the available treatments, the likelihood of response to treatment and possible adverse effects. Showing support and providing reassurance throughout the depressive episode can lessen feelings of hopelessness and encourage treatment adherence.<br>Psychoeducation should be accompanied by support to help the patient modify their lifestyle, if necessary. Lifestyle modification can include improving sleep hygiene, undertaking adequate physical activity (see below), consuming a healthy diet (see below), minimising alcohol consumption, reducing stress, and reviewing daily routines and social support.<br>Exercise is an effective treatment, either alone or as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions or pharmacotherapy for major depression [Note 1].<br>There is increasing evidence of a relationship between diet and mental health. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, cereals, legumes and fish) has been associated with a decreased risk of depression. Additionally, diets with high levels of processed foods have been found to contribute to depressive symptoms. Depression can influence eating habits. For example, patients with depression may restrict their eating or overeat in response to their symptoms. Hence, in addition to providing advice about the importance of a healthy and balanced diet, it can be helpful to enquire about patients’ specific eating habits and address any issues that may be contributing to their mental health issues [Note 2].<br>Implement simple psychosocial interventions in all patients with major depression.<br>Use a shared decision-making approach when discussing further treatment options (psychological therapies, antidepressants or both) with patients. Specific considerations for treating a young person with major depression are described below.<br>When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:<br>The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of pharmacological treatment, although suicide attempt rates remain lower than before treatment is started.

There is a risk of developing agitation, activation and suicidal thoughts when starting treatment with any SSRI, particularly in the first 7 to 10 days. However, of the SSRIs, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with a greater risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours and other serious adverse events. Because there is more safety data for fluoxetine in children, it is the preferred SSRI. SSRIs are effective treatments for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, so may be particularly useful if there is a comorbid anxiety disorder. No SSRIs are approved to treat major depression in children in Australia.<br>There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing.

However, if a TCA is well tolerated and effective in an older person, it is unnecessary to switch to another antidepressant; switching may cause a relapse, and is of particular concern in patients with a history of severe episodes, hospitalisation or suicide attempt.<br>A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and close monitoring for postural dizziness using lying and standing blood pressure in the first 2 weeks and after dosage changes is recommended.<br>An appropriate regimen in adults or young people is:<br><br>Low doses of intravenous ketamine significantly and rapidly decrease depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, there are insufficient data to recommend routine use of ketamine for treatment-resistant major depression.<br>Intranasal esketamine, a racemic isomer of ketamine, has demonstrated efficacy for treatment-resistant depression, but it is not licensed for use in Australia. Intranasal esketamine is approved for use in other countries as an adjunct to oral antidepressant therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Intranasal esketamine is not recommended because data on long-term maintenance of effect and safety are still in development.<br><br>Treatment-resistant major depression in children<br>Treatment-resistant major depression is defined as depressive symptoms that persist despite using an effective dose of at least 2 antidepressants as sequential monotherapy, each for a minimum of 4 weeks. Consider if any of the reasons for antidepressant nonresponse listed in Box 8.30 could account for poor response; if not, refer the child to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input. Other antidepressants that may be considered by psychiatrists include tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); however, evidence of their efficacy is minimal and drugs from these classes are usually only used in adolescents.<br><br>Recurrent major depression in adults and young people<br>Most patients with major depression will experience more than one episode in their lifetime. Episodes that occur after having achieved full remission are referred to as recurrent episodes.<br>If the patient is not taking an antidepressant at the time of recurrence, treat the recurrent episode with the antidepressant that previously achieved remission; however, also consider the guidance on antidepressant choice here. Use the recommended starting dose (see Antidepressant regimens for major depression in adults and young people) and target the dose that previously achieved remission. The same dose provides greater protection from recurrence than using a reduced prophylactic dose.<br>If the recurrence occurs while the patient is taking an antidepressant, consider increasing the dose of antidepressant, which may help achieve remission of symptoms. If a dose increase is not possible, consider using a different antidepressant. See Antidepressant regimens for major depression in adults and young people or, if 2 or more antidepressants have been trialled, see Treatment-resistant major depression in adults and young people. When changing from one antidepressant to another, refer to Switching antidepressants.<br>If a patient has had 2 or more depressive episodes within 5 years, 3 or more cumulative episodes, psychotic depression or a serious suicide attempt, continue antidepressant therapy for 3 to 5 years—sometimes lifelong therapy is required.<br>Psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either alone or in conjunction with antidepressants, reduce the likelihood of depressive relapse. After acute treatment, 3-monthly ‘booster’ sessions with a psychologist during the first year of recovery can help prevent further relapse.<br>During remission, address factors that increase the risk of recurrent episodes, if possible. Educate patients and, if appropriate, their family, carers or significant others, on how to identify early warning signs of relapse and develop a plan for early intervention.<br>After the antidepressant course is complete, review the need for further management, taking into account any comorbid conditions and risk factors for further relapse. Some patients require lifelong antidepressant therapy.<br>Augmenting antidepressants with lithium reduces recurrences of major depression, especially for patients who experience recurrent depressive episodes while taking antidepressants. Augmentation with lithium is ideally initiated under the guidance of a psychiatrist. Combination treatment with an antidepressant and lithium may be required for long-term prophylaxis if prophylactic treatment with an antidepressant alone is inadequate.<br>There is a limited role for maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the specialist treatment of severe recurrent treatment-resistant depression.<br><br>Complementary medicines for major depression<br>Complementary medicines are commonly used by patients with major depression but their safety, quality and efficacy are not well established. In some instances, their use can lead to significant drug interactions or adverse effects. St John’s wort and omega-3 fatty acids have the most evidence of efficacy for major depression. Studies have shown that extracts of St John’s wort are effective for the treatment of mild to moderate major depression in adults. Omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in the treatment of major depression but there is not adequate evidence to support their routine use.

manic-episodes-bipolar-disorder,"Principles of managing acute mania in adults and young people<br>For multifaceted management of bipolar disorder that is not restricted to an episode of acute mania, see Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people.<br>Before comprehensively assessing a person with manic symptoms, determine if they pose a threat to themselves or others. If there is a risk of harm, see Approach to managing acute behavioural disturbance.<br>Assessment of a patient with acute mania is best undertaken by a specialist—urgently refer people with manic symptoms to a psychiatrist or mental health service. Young people should ideally be referred to a youth mental health service such as Headspace, if available. For a first presentation of acute mania, psychiatrist review is particularly important to confirm the diagnosis; psychoeducation about bipolar disorder is also required.<br>Start treatment in liaison with a psychiatrist but do not delay treatment if prompt psychiatrist review is not available.<br>Determine the severity of mania symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms of mania usually have impaired insight and judgement, and risk causing significant harm to themselves or others (eg engaging in behaviour that damages their reputation, relationships or finances; aggression or physical harm to others). Determine whether the patient has engaged in uncharacteristic behaviour and help them to address any consequences of this behaviour.<br>Patients with severe symptoms of mania who are a danger to themselves or others require urgent treatment in hospital [Note 1]. The primary aim of treatment is to curb disturbed behaviour (eg aggression, violence, agitation, overactivity, disinhibition)—an antipsychotic is used to rapidly achieve this. Additional intervention may be required to calm patients who are severely agitated, or are behaving in a threatening or aggressive manner. Start lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine simultaneously with the antipsychotic. See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people for more detail and drug regimens. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe acute mania.<br>Patients with less severe symptoms of mania also require prompt treatment but may not need to be hospitalised. Treatment in the community is preferred and may be delivered by a community mental health team, a shared-care program with the treating psychiatrist and general practitioner, or an outpatient program. Link patients to an acute specialist treatment team (eg crisis assessment and treatment team). Start combination therapy with an antipsychotic (to rapidly reduce the symptoms of mania), and lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine (for maintenance therapy). See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adutls and young people for more detail and drug regimens.<br>In addition to starting pharmacological treatment, immediately stop or rapidly reduce any drug the patient is currently taking that has mood-elevating properties (eg antidepressant, stimulant).<br>Once acute mania has stabilised, offer relevant psychosocial interventions. Optimised multimodal therapy and an adequate duration of drug therapy can prevent recurrent episodes, which are associated with worse long-term outcomes. Poor treatment adherence can lead to relapse or recurrent episodes; check blood drug concentrations where relevant [Note 2] [Note 3]. Other common causes of recurrence or relapse include substance abuse, antidepressant use, stressful life events and sleep deprivation. Some patients will relapse in the absence of any of these factors. If relapse occurs, treat according to the mood episode and consider the need for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, in consultation with the patient’s psychiatrist.<br>See also the additional considerations:<br><br>Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people<br>See Principles of managing acute mania in adults and young people for advice on the setting in which initial treatment should be delivered, the requirement for psychiatrist oversight and an overview of management. Involuntary treatment is often necessary [Note 4].<br>An antipsychotic is the most effective drug for rapidly reducing symptoms of acute mania but is usually stopped once acute mania remits because lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine are preferred for maintenance therapy. Lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine is started in parallel with an antipsychotic, which may enhance resolution of the acute mania. Additional short-term pharmacotherapy may be needed for patients with severe agitation or threatening and aggressive behaviour.<br>The pharmacological treatment of acute mania is summarised in Table 8.5.<br>Review response to treatment every 2 to 3 days. Agitation, difficulty sleeping and aggressive behaviour often start to settle within a few days, while the underlying elevated or irritable mood and any associated psychotic features may take up to a month to resolve. If there is no response to initial treatment, or the treatment response is inadequate, seek expert advice (see also Nonresponse to treatment for acute mania).<br>Simultaneously monitor the tolerability of treatment—tolerability is an important consideration because drug therapy is usually prolonged.<br>Consider contraindications, precautions, adverse effects, dosage adjustments, clinical monitoring requirements before and during therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring [Note 5] [Note 6]. For the principles of antipsychotic use, see here. Consult a drug information source for other drugs.<br>After acute mania has resolved and the patient is euthymic (ie has a stable mental state that is neither manic nor depressed), monotherapy with lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine for maintenance therapy is preferred—follow the psychiatrist’s treatment plan for stopping the antipsychotic and any adjunctive pharmacotherapy for agitation.<br>Use maintenance therapy for at least 6 months after a first manic episode, then assess whether prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.

For drugs with similar efficacy, choice should be guided by the adverse effect profile and whether these are acceptable to the patient. Also consider the availability of a long-acting injectable formulation. Young people in particular are at risk of antipsychotic adverse effects including extrapyramidal adverse effects, effects due to elevated blood prolactin concentration, and weight gain.<br>Of the antipsychotics listed below, olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol are the most effective antipsychotics for initial treatment of acute mania. The use of haloperidol is limited by its association with extrapyramidal adverse effects.<br>Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40. Dosage should be guided by response to therapy and tolerability (regularly monitor for adverse effects). Slower dose escalation may be required for people who are antipsychotic naive, to reduce the likelihood of antipsychotic adverse effects.<br>If adverse effects are suspected, lower the dose or switch to another drug with a lower propensity for adverse effects—see Switching antipsychotics.<br>For initial treatment of acute mania, use one of the following antipsychotics, concurrently with lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine. Use:<br>If daytime sedation is an issue with once-daily doses, give the dose at night.<br>If there is no response to treatment within a few weeks, see Nonresponse to treatment for acute mania.<br>If there is an acceptable response, continue combination therapy until acute symptoms have remitted, then follow the psychiatrist’s treatment plan for stopping the antipsychotic. Continue with lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine as monotherapy for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.<br><br>Lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine for acute mania in adults and young people<br>See Overview of pharmacotherapy for acute mania in adults and young people for the role of lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine in the maintenance treatment of mania and use in specific populations (eg pregnant people, young people).<br>Lithium is the most effective drug for preventing relapse of mania.

Use:<br>If there is no response to treatment within a few weeks, see Nonresponse to treatment for acute mania.<br>If there is an acceptable response, continue treatment for at least 6 to 12 months to prevent relapse, then assess if prophylaxis of bipolar disorder is required.<br><br>Treating agitation in adults and young people with acute mania<br>Agitation is a common symptom of acute mania that varies in duration and severity, ranging from mild (eg pacing, fidgeting) to severe (eg uncooperative, threatening or aggressive behaviours). If initial treatment with an antipsychotic plus lithium, sodium valproate or carbamazepine is not effective in managing agitation, further intervention may be required.<br>If a patient with mania is acutely agitated, only provide treatment if it is safe and appropriate to do so. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm.<br>If a patient with acute mania remains agitated but is willing to accept an oral drug, consider using a suitable dose of the patient’s antipsychotic or adding a benzodiazepine. Drug choice is influenced by current treatment, previous response, severity of agitation and patient factors. An antipsychotic is preferred for more severe agitation; however, there are few data to support ‘as needed’ (prn) administration of antipsychotics, and it can worsen agitation and increase the risk of adverse effects (eg akathisia). For a first episode of mania, it may be preferable to use a benzodiazepine to minimise exposure to antipsychotics; however, high doses of benzodiazepines can cause delirium, which can cause or worsen agitation.<br>See the additional considerations in drug choice:<br>If a benzodiazepine is preferred, use:<br>When selecting a suitable benzodiazepine dose, consider patient factors, such as level of agitation, body size, age, sex, comorbidities, treatment setting, drug history, previous response to sedative drugs and response to treatment. Modest benzodiazepine doses should be used initially in patients treated in the community, particularly in those who are benzodiazepine naïve.<br>If an antipsychotic is preferred, use a suitable dose of the patient’s antipsychotic as required, but do not exceed the maximum daily dose of the antipsychotic (including regular doses). After the agitation has resolved, do not continue the antipsychotic at the increased dose to manage mania.<br>If the patient remains acutely agitated and at risk of harming themselves or others 30 to 60 minutes after the administration of the benzodiazepine or antipsychotic, or if the patient will not accept an oral drug, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for further advice.<br>Consult a psychiatrist to consider zuclopenthixol acetate if the patient has any of the following features:<br>If recurrent agitation and aggression is likely to continue for the next 2 to 3 days, if appropriate, a psychiatrist may use:<br>Zuclopenthixol acetate has an onset of action within 2 hours and the peak effect is achieved approximately 24 hours after administration.

Avoid long-acting injectable haloperidol and olanzapine because of the risk of serious adverse effects—see Antipsychotic adverse effects for more detail.<br>When starting a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, it is preferable to use an antipsychotic that the patient has tolerated in oral form and, ideally, has responded to and is stabilised on (ie taken for at least 2 weeks). This:<br>If the patient takes an oral antipsychotic other than aripiprazole or risperidone, first switch to one of those drugs to establish tolerability.<br>When choosing between aripiprazole and risperidone, discuss antipsychotic choice with the patient and, if they consent, their family, carers or significant others using the discussion points here.<br>Establish baseline values of parameters that can be affected by antipsychotic therapy—see Box 8.40.

mental-health-disorders-following-trauma,"Overview of mental health disorders following trauma exposure<br>Exposure to a traumatic event commonly results in psychological distress. Events that pose an actual or perceived threat to the life or physical safety of the person, or others around them, can be traumatic; examples include war, physical or sexual assault, kidnap, terrorist attacks, torture, natural disasters and severe motor vehicle accidents. A miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or difficult childbirth or pregnancy can also be traumatic, especially in people with a history of sexual trauma.<br>Psychological symptoms of distress usually settle in the days to weeks following the traumatic event but a minority of people have persisting symptoms and develop acute stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<br>Acute stress disorder is characterised by significant distress or functional impairment after a traumatic event. Symptoms last for more than 2 days but less than 1 month and, in most people, spontaneously remit. Intrusion (persistent re-experience of the traumatic event), marked dissociation, avoidance and heightened arousal are common.<br>PTSD is characterised by intrusion, persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event, negative thoughts or feelings, and marked alterations in reactivity and arousal (eg irritability, aggression, difficulty concentrating). Symptoms last for more than 1 month. A diagnosis of delayed-expression PTSD is made if symptoms first occur more than 6 months after exposure.<br>Suspected acute stress disorder or PTSD in a child should be evaluated using a developmentally informed approach. Symptoms in children may include withdrawal, disruptive behaviours, inattention, nightmares, or repeated play with themes or re-enactment of the traumatic event. Symptoms in children 6 years or younger can also include regressive behaviours, excessive tantrums, crying, clinginess or immobility. The impact of a traumatic event on a child can be influenced by their caregiver’s reaction to the trauma and ability to provide support.<br>People with acute stress disorder or PTSD commonly have comorbid problem substance use, or major depression; these comorbidities require treatment. Somatic complaints may also be experienced.<br>People with PTSD associated with childbirth or pregnancy may avoid their infants, which can cause problems with emotional regulation in the infant. PTSD related to childbirth or pregnancy may also lead to avoidance of sexual activity and a fear of further childbearing (tocophobia).<br>For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.<br>For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as acute stress disorder and PTSD in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.<br><br>Early interventions following trauma exposure<br>Offer adults and young people who have been exposed to trauma practical and emotional support, encourage them to use coping strategies and access social supports, and provide advice on good sleep practices. More detail can be found in the Mental Health First Aid Australia guidelines. Routine structured interventions (eg psychological debriefing) are no longer recommended following trauma exposure. Pharmacotherapy does not have any role in the prevention of acute or posttraumatic stress disorder.<br>Closely but unobtrusively monitor the patient’s recovery. Symptoms remit spontaneously in the vast majority of people and intervention is not necessary. However, consider psychosocial interventions if symptoms persist for 1 month or more, or earlier if the person is at risk of developing PTSD (eg past history of trauma, exposure to additional stressors after the traumatic event).<br>Early interventions in children are similar to those in adults and young people, but should be tailored to the child’s developmental stage.<br><br>Psychosocial interventions for acute or posttraumatic stress disorder in adults and young people<br>Trauma-focused psychosocial interventions are effective for both acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

obsessive-compulsive-disorder,"Overview of obsessive compulsive disorder<br>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted. In most people, obsessions cause marked anxiety or distress. The person usually attempts to ignore or suppress these thoughts, impulses or images, or to counter them by performing a compulsion. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours (eg hand washing, checking) or mental acts (eg counting) that the person feels compelled to undertake in response to an obsession in order to prevent discomfort, or a dreaded event that the compulsion cannot realistically affect. The person usually recognises that their behaviour is excessive or unreasonable.<br>The obsessions or compulsions can significantly interfere with the person’s life and can impact people living or working with them.<br>The lifetime prevalence of OCD is 2 to 2.5%. Childhood OCD occurs in the same form as that seen in adults and usually manifests between 5 and 15 years.<br><br>Obsessive compulsive disorder during the perinatal period<br>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) can be particularly challenging during the perinatal period.<br>Antenatal OCD can cause significant distress and poorer perinatal outcomes. Specific behaviours may affect the pregnancy (eg obsessions about contaminated food may lead to restricted eating and malnutrition). OCD is more prevalent among pregnant females than those who are not pregnant; up to 40% of females who develop OCD experience its onset during pregnancy.<br>Postnatal OCD can impair a parent’s ability to care for their infant.<br>Thoughts of intentional infant harm (eg physical or sexual abuse) are distressing but common after a person gives birth. Most people dismiss such thoughts but people with OCD may obsess over them and become concerned about unwillingly acting upon them. This can lead them to experience feelings of extreme guilt and fear, and worry that they want to harm their infant or there is ‘something wrong with them’.<br>If a person expresses thoughts of harming their infant, determine whether there is a risk of infant harm (eg the patient has delusions that could indicate postpartum psychosis and potential for infanticide or suicide; the patient expresses definite intent). Mothers with OCD rarely pose a risk of harm to their infant. Thoughts of infant harm are likely to be associated with OCD if the mother:<br>Respond to thoughts of infant harm tactfully. If the thoughts are obviously related to OCD and reflect anxiety rather than risk of infant harm, provide the patient and, if they consent, their partner with reassurance and psychoeducation. Overreacting (eg by reporting a patient with OCD to child protection services or not allowing them to be alone with their infant) can worsen OCD, disrupt the family and impair parent–infant attachment. Comorbid severe depression, psychosis, substance use disorders and reduced impulse control (eg personality disorder) pose a higher risk of infant harm. Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist, particularly if the risk of harm to the infant is uncertain. If the risk of harm seems high, consider an urgent psychiatric assessment (eg by a community mental health team, in an emergency department).<br>People who experience postnatal obsessional thoughts about their infant may not have OCD—almost half of patients with postnatal depression have such thoughts.<br>For additional considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as OCD in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.<br><br>Approach to managing obsessive compulsive disorder in adults and young people<br>Adults and young people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) may be best managed by a psychiatrist. Combining psychosocial and pharmacological treatments is usually associated with the best response.<br>Psychosocial interventions are first line but some patients require initial pharmacotherapy to actively engage in psychosocial interventions.

Off-label recommendations have been included for an indication when the medicine is considered to be a safe and effective treatment.<br>It is important to discuss off-label use of a medicine with the patient to explain the rationale for use. In line with good clinical practice, obtain informed consent before prescribing off label. Monitor physiological and psychological indices of adverse effects and therapeutic outcomes in patients taking off-label medicines. Document off-label use in the patient’s records and advise the patient that consumer information may not include information about unapproved uses.<br>Prescribers should be able to justify off-label use of a medicine with evidence and be confident in its use.

Showing support and providing reassurance can lessen anxiety symptoms and encourage treatment adherence.<br>Psychoeducation should be accompanied by support to help the patient modify their lifestyle, if necessary. Lifestyle modification can include improving sleep hygiene, undertaking adequate physical activity (see below), consuming a healthy diet (see below), minimising alcohol and caffeine consumption, reducing stress, reviewing daily routines and encouraging social support.<br>Exercise may be a helpful adjunct for people experiencing anxiety [Note 2]; exercise may decrease panic symptoms by lowering a person’s sensitivity to internal symptoms that are similar to panic, and their sensitivity to carbon dioxide (which plays a role in inducing anxiety symptoms).<br>Anxiety can affect eating habits (eg patients may restrict their eating or overeat in response to their symptoms).

Psychosocial interventions or pharmacotherapy may be appropriate as initial treatment options, depending on the patient and the specific anxiety disorder being treated—see Box 8.8 for types of anxiety disorders.<br>Managing patients with anxiety disorders may involve the concurrent use of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments. Historically there were concerns that combining benzodiazepines with psychosocial treatment may lead to poorer outcomes.

overview-bipolar-disorder,"Overview of bipolar disorder<br>Bipolar disorder is characterised by distinct episodes of mania or hypomania, and depression—see Features of bipolar disorder.<br>The lifetime prevalence is approximately 0.6% for bipolar I disorder and 0.4% for bipolar II disorder. Bipolar disorder can reduce a person’s life expectancy by approximately 10 years (mainly due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, diabetes, and suicide), and affect their relationships, career and self-esteem. The risk of suicide is significant (up to 30 times greater than the general population), particularly during a depressive episode, or in patients with mixed features or rapid cycling bipolar disorder.<br>Bipolar disorder has a strong genetic basis and a peak onset in young people. Bipolar II disorder is more common in females, whereas the incidence of bipolar I disorder is the same in males and females.<br><br>Features of bipolar disorder<br>The mood episodes of bipolar disorder are mania, hypomania and depression.<br>Acute mania is a distinct period with an abrupt onset of symptoms, including abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood, accelerated speech, racing thoughts with flight of ideas, increased activity and reduced sleep requirements. Patients may develop grandiose ideas, act recklessly (including increased spending), and have increased sexual drive and activity. Patients who have psychosis are considered to have a severe presentation. To diagnose mania, symptoms must be present for most of the day, cause marked functional impairment and last for at least 1 week. However, a diagnosis of acute mania can be made with symptoms of any duration if the patient requires admission to hospital because of their symptoms.<br>A hypomanic episode is characterised by symptoms similar to those of a manic episode, but is differentiated from a manic episode by less severe symptoms that do not impair functioning. The symptoms last at least 4 consecutive days and are present for most of the day. People with hypomania do not experience psychotic symptoms.<br>Depressive episodes last for at least 2 weeks and must include a depressed mood, or a loss of interest or pleasure, for most of the day. The episode must cause significant distress or impair the person’s functioning; during depressive episodes, there is a high risk of suicide. While most symptoms overlap with those of major depression, patients with bipolar depression are more likely to have atypical depressive features (eg excessive sleeping or eating), psychomotor slowing, psychotic features or mixed features (ie manic or hypomanic features interspersed in the depression). Most patients experience at least one depressive episode before developing a first episode of mania or hypomania. Depressive episodes are the predominant mood episode for most patients with bipolar disorder, especially those with bipolar II disorder. Patients with bipolar disorder also frequently experience periods of subthreshold depressive symptoms between the major mood episodes.<br>Mixed features describes the simultaneous experience of symptoms opposite to the predominant state (eg during a manic episode, patients also experience depressive symptoms). Mixed features can occur during a manic, hypomanic or depressive episode.<br>Rapid cycling bipolar disorder can occur in some patients, in which at least 4 mood episodes are experienced in a 12-month period (ie manic, hypomanic or depressive episodes). This is the most difficult to treat of all bipolar disorder presentations.<br><br>Subtypes of bipolar disorder<br>The 2 predominant subtypes of bipolar disorder are bipolar I and bipolar II. There is debate about whether it is worthwhile to distinguish between bipolar I and bipolar II disorder but international consensus favours using the distinction.<br>Bipolar I disorder is characterised by at least one manic episode, usually accompanied by depressive episodes, that are not better explained by another disorder. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment.<br>Bipolar II disorder is characterised by hypomanic and depressive episodes that are not better explained by another disorder. The depressive episodes cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment.<br>Other subtypes of bipolar disorder (eg cyclothymic disorder, substance or drug-induced bipolar disorder) are not discussed in these guidelines.<br><br>Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in adults and young people<br>Diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires an accurate history about past mood episodes (see Features of bipolar disorder), including their number, frequency, intensity and duration. See here for characteristics of common bipolar disorder subtypes. Refer to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis.<br>Often a patient will initially present with a depressive episode; a diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made once an episode of mania or hypomania occurs. Hypomania can be particularly difficult to recognise because patients rarely seek treatment during a hypomanic episode. Ask all patients presenting with depressive symptoms about possible prior episodes of hypomania or mania, or a family history of bipolar disorder.<br>If a patient presents with manic or hypomanic symptoms, exclude other causes of their symptoms. If the patient has psychotic symptoms, also consider alternative causes of psychoses—see Box 8.39. Consider an underlying physical disorder (eg neurological, endocrine), particularly in patients older than 40 years because a first episode of mania is uncommon in this group; the peak onset of bipolar disorder is in young people.<br>Symptoms of bipolar disorder often overlap with other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, which can lead to misdiagnosis and consequently incorrect treatment. Approximately 50% of patients have concurrent alcohol or other substance problems, or an anxiety disorder. Correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder is often delayed by years, and consequently management may be suboptimal during this time.<br><br>Approach to diagnosing bipolar disorder in children<br>Bipolar disorder is extremely rare before puberty. Urgently refer children who display symptoms of bipolar disorder to a specialist centre (eg Headspace for children 12 years or older) or, if a specialist centre is not available, a psychiatrist or mental health team experienced in treating bipolar disorder in children. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children is difficult, and requires expertise; the diagnosis is unstable and requires confirmation with prospective longitudinal monitoring.<br>Bipolar disorder is overdiagnosed in children with chronic irritability and disruptive behaviour—symptoms that are also characteristic of relational or attachment problems, and other psychiatric disorders. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a new diagnosis intended to describe many children with chronic irritability and disruptive behaviour, who would previously have inappropriately received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The creation of the diagnosis aims to reduce misdiagnosis and overtreatment, but it is not universally accepted.<br><br>Principles of managing bipolar disorder in adults and young people<br>Most people with bipolar disorder require psychiatrist management. The general practitioner’s role includes facilitating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, accessing specialist care and other services, and providing ongoing general medical care, monitoring and support to the patient. Shared care between the general practitioner and psychiatrist can improve health outcomes.<br>Other clinicians may be part of the multidisciplinary team depending on the patient’s needs, including a clinical psychologist, mental health nurse, occupational therapist and social worker. If available, an exercise physiologist and peer workers should be included in this team.<br>It is crucial for members of this team (particularly the primary clinician) to foster a therapeutic alliance with the patient to ensure continuity of care.

Often a patient with bipolar disorder will initially present with a depressive episode; a diagnosis of bipolar disorder can only be made once an episode of mania or hypomania occurs.

panic-attack,"Overview of panic attack<br>A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort. Symptoms of a panic attack may initially suggest an acute medical condition (eg heart attack, stroke, hyperthyroidism, a respiratory condition such as asthma) or a psychiatric disorder (eg social anxiety disorder, major depression, a psychotic disorder). Isolated panic attacks are common, occurring in around 15% of the population.<br>To diagnose a panic attack, 4 or more of the following symptoms need to have developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes:<br>Exclude conditions that may cause similar symptoms (eg asthma). Physical symptoms of pregnancy (eg tachycardia, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath) can mimic or precipitate a panic attack.<br>A panic attack can occur in the absence of a psychiatric disorder, or it can be a symptom of an anxiety disorder or other psychiatric disorder. For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see here.<br>A single panic attack is not the same as panic disorder, which is characterised by recurrent panic attacks that are not associated with a situational trigger (ie occur spontaneously).<br>Use psychosocial interventions to manage a panic attack. If the panic attack is a symptom of an anxiety disorder or other psychiatric disorder, treat the underlying condition accordingly. Short-term pharmacotherapy may be appropriate if psychosocial interventions are ineffective or not preferred.<br>When evaluating treatment options for a young person, also consider:<br>For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.<br>For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as panic attack in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.<br><br>Psychosocial interventions for panic attack<br>Use psychosocial interventions initially in the treatment of a panic attack in adults, young people and children. Breathing techniques (ie breathing slowly and deeply) can be used immediately to raise arterial carbon dioxide concentration; this abolishes many acute symptoms.<br>As soon as possible after a panic attack, provide psychoeducation to the patient and, if relevant, their family, carers or significant others. Providing an explanation of a panic attack, support and stress management advice can be effective.<br><br>Pharmacotherapy for panic attack in adults and young people<br>If psychosocial interventions are not effective or preferred, short-term pharmacotherapy with a benzodiazepine may be appropriate. However, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence. These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use; in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits (see Principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders).<br>If a benzodiazepine is considered appropriate for panic attack in an adult or young person, use:<br>If a panic attack worsens or does not resolve despite using psychosocial and pharmacological treatment, manage as for an acute behavioural disturbance.

If symptoms of a panic attack do not resolve with psychosocial intervention or rapid resolution of symptoms is needed in a crisis, pharmacotherapy may be used. Pharmacotherapy is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. If a drug is required, use this concurrently with psychosocial interventions if possible.<br>Benzodiazepine use in children is not supported by controlled trials. Furthermore, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, daytime sedation and dependence, and may cause paradoxical disinhibition in children. Nevertheless, a single dose of a benzodiazepine may be used if rapid resolution of symptoms is needed in a crisis, or to help alleviate acute panic symptoms and allow the child to engage in psychosocial treatment (eg exposure therapy in school refusal). Follow the principles of benzodiazepine use in anxiety disorders.<br>If a benzodiazepine is indicated for panic attack, a suitable regimen in children 6 years or older is:<br>In the rare circumstance that pharmacotherapy is required in a child younger than 6 years, seek specialist advice on dosing."
panic-disorder,"Overview of panic disorder<br>Panic disorder affects 2 to 3% of the population and is 3 times more common in females than males. It is characterised by recurrent panic attacks, in which the onset of the attack is not associated with a trigger (ie occur spontaneously), and not caused by a substance, drug, medical condition or another psychiatric disorder (eg depression, bipolar disorder).<br>Associated symptoms of panic disorder include:<br>The presentation in children is similar to that in adults and young people.<br>For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.<br>Use psychosocial interventions as first-line treatment for panic disorder.

Pregnant females are more likely to experience panic disorder than those who are not pregnant; onset tends to be in the first and second trimesters. Individuals with panic disorder may avoid antenatal appointments because they fear having panic attacks during travel to or attendance at appointments. Poorer antenatal care attendance increases the risk of poor obstetric outcomes. For additional considerations in managing anxiety disorders in the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners, see here.<br><br>Psychosocial interventions for panic disorder<br>Use psychosocial interventions as first-line treatment for panic disorder.<br>Provide psychoeducation about the disorder; in particular, explain how the panic attack produces physical symptoms. Advise the patient to use the breathing control techniques described for the treatment of acute panic attack and relaxation strategies.<br>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for panic disorder—CBT can be used to challenge misattributions about the physiological symptoms of panic and to establish strategies to manage them. Several types of CBT can be used for panic disorder. The most commonly used is panic control treatment, which involves exposure to deliberately induce symptoms together with techniques (eg controlled slow breathing) for controlling them, and reattribution of symptoms to benign causes (eg palpitations are not due to cardiac arrest).<br>There is limited evidence for acceptance and commitment therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy.<br><br>Maintenance pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in adults and young people<br>For the acute management of a panic attack, see here.<br>Treat panic disorder with psychosocial interventions.

If psychosocial interventions are not available, not effective or not preferred, pharmacotherapy may be considered, but is usually reserved for children with severe symptoms. If possible, pharmacotherapy should be combined with psychosocial interventions. Many children with panic disorder respond well to a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]). If pharmacotherapy is used, it is ideally started by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are preferred; however, paroxetine is not recommended in children because it has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and other serious adverse events. A benzodiazepine may be considered to manage an acute panic attack—see here.<br>There is limited evidence to guide dosing of SSRIs in children. The dosage regimens in these guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion and are included as a guide to suitable dosing. If the dosage regimens in these guidelines prove inadequate (eg higher doses are needed), expert advice should be sought because alternative regimens may be appropriate.<br>Starting patients on a low dose may help to decrease initial adverse effects (eg nausea, restlessness, agitation). However, the use of a lower starting dose prolongs the time taken to achieve therapeutic effect. See here for information on managing adverse effects.<br>Do not use pharmacotherapy for children 6 years or younger.<br>In children older than 6 years and younger than 12 years, if pharmacotherapy is considered necessary for panic disorder, use:<br>When deciding upon a suitable dosing regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12-year-olds might be metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults). At the lower end of the dose range, the recommended doses approximate those used in younger children, whereas the maximum doses approximate those used in adults and young people.

These risks are of particular concern in older people and people with a history of problem substance use (particularly problem alcohol use); in these people, harms of benzodiazepine use may outweigh benefits.<br>Benzodiazepine use is usually restricted to acute crises (see Panic attack) and short-term initial therapy.

Doses of TCAs for treating panic disorder are often higher than the doses for treating depression; however, the dose must be increased gradually to reduce initial adverse effects. Lower doses may be needed in older people; consult a source of drug information. Intolerance commonly limits the use of TCAs, and toxicity in overdose must be considered. TCAs can cause changes in cardiac conduction—an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained before treatment is started and repeated once the dose is stabilised, usually after 6 weeks. If either ECG shows abnormalities, seek advice from a cardiologist before starting or continuing treatment.<br>If a TCA is considered appropriate for panic disorder, a suitable regimen in adults and young people is:<br>Psychiatrists may use phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor [MAOI]) in treatment resistance; however, dietary restrictions hinder its use (see Principles of using irreversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]).<br><br>Nonresponse to maintenance pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in children<br>Refer children with panic disorder to a child psychiatrist, or an age-appropriate mental health service for multidisciplinary input, if their symptoms persist despite:"
parasomnias,"Introduction to parasomnias<br>Parasomnias are undesirable behaviours or experiences that occur while falling asleep, sleeping or waking.<br>Parasomnias are classified into 3 broad groups according to the stage of sleep in which they occur:<br><br>Non-REM parasomnias<br>Sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleepwalking are disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. During these parasomnias, which typically occur during the first half of sleep, a person appears to be awake and asleep at the same time. Upon waking, the event is usually not remembered.<br>A sleep terror (night terror) is characterised by an intense feeling of fear often accompanied by screaming and crying, violent thrashing movements and autonomic activation (eg sweating and tachycardia). The person may not wake during the sleep terror but, if they do, can be disorientated.<br>A confusional arousal is characterised by confusion upon arousal from sleep. The person may sit up in bed, look around and speak, but appear confused and unaware of their surroundings. These episodes are short; the person usually returns to sleep.<br>Sleepwalking occurs when a person who is asleep walks and potentially engages in an activity (eg talking, driving, cooking, moving furniture).<br>Non-REM parasomnias are common and most frequently occur in children. Stress, sleep deprivation, drugs (especially alcohol, zolpidem, lithium), physical illness and other sleep disorders (eg sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements) can be precipitants. If a non-REM parasomnia first presents in adulthood, it is likely to be caused by an adverse drug effect, stress or a neurological disorder (eg sleep-related epilepsy).<br>Manage a non-REM parasomnia by educating the person and their significant other(s) about the condition. Patient information on sleep terrors and sleep walking is available on the Sleep Health Foundation website. The Royal Children’s Hospital provides advice for parents with children who have sleep terrors (see here) or sleepwalk (see here).<br>As people do not usually recall non-REM parasomnias, distress may be minimised by not waking them during an episode. If a drug is suspected to be causing the parasomnia, reduce the dose or stop the drug if possible. If lack of sleep is a likely precipitant, see here for advice for adults and the Raising Children website for advice for children and adolescents.<br>If sleepwalking is frequent or dangerous to the patient or others, make the sleeping environment safe. As relevant, recommend:<br>Refer the patient to a sleep specialist, and in the case of children, a paediatrician, if:<br>Pharmacotherapy is rarely required for non-REM parasomnias. However, sleep specialists will sometimes use a benzodiazepine if sleepwalking or sleep terrors are significantly affecting the patient’s quality of life or placing them or those around them in danger, and other interventions are ineffective.<br><br>REM Parasomnias<br>A nightmare is a disturbing dream that usually occurs late in sleep, during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase. Upon wakening, the person will quickly orientate and vividly remember the nightmare, which can cause distress. Nightmares are common (particularly in children) and most often, are a normal part of life, not requiring treatment. However, if nightmares are recurrent and cause significant distress or functional impairment, further investigation is required.<br>Recurrent nightmares featuring a repeated story are commonly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—see here for PTSD diagnosis and management, including management of nightmares.<br>Some drugs (eg beta blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists) can cause vivid dreams or nightmares. If a drug is suspected to be the cause of ongoing nightmares, consider adjusting the time of administration, reducing the dose or stopping the drug—often nightmares will then resolve. Conversely, withdrawing or stopping drugs that suppress REM sleep (eg alcohol, antidepressants, some hypnotics) can precipitate nightmares.<br>If recurrent nightmares appear to have no clear cause, consider psychological therapies (eg imagery rehearsal therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy). If these therapies are not effective or unavailable, seek specialist advice for further treatment options.<br>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is characterised by complex motor activity and vocal dream enactment behaviour associated with loss of normal REM muscle tone (atonia). This parasomnia can result in violent and dangerous behaviour during sleep. REM sleep behaviour disorder is predominantly seen in older people and affects more males than females (ratio 9:1). In most patients, REM sleep behaviour disorder precedes or is associated with alpha synucleinopathies (eg Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple systems atrophy). REM sleep behaviour disorder is occasionally associated with other neurological disorders (eg narcolepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders) or drugs (eg alcohol, antidepressants, beta blockers).<br>If REM sleep behaviour disorder is suspected, refer the patient to a sleep specialist or neurologist for evaluation and treatment. Differential diagnoses include nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, posttraumatic stress disorder and other parasomnias.<br>Counsel the patient about ways to make their sleep environment safer (eg remove furniture or objects near the bed that could cause injury; move the bed away from windows; avoid sleeping with other people).

personality-disorder,"Diagnosing personality disorder<br>Personality is a person’s unique combination of general tendencies or traits, desires, beliefs, concerns, coping mechanisms, and life story (narrative). Personality is considered normal when it allows a person to adapt to their circumstances and environment, but what is considered normal can depend on cultural norms (eg high emotional expression is expected in some societies but not others). Personality disorder occurs when features of a person’s personality are inflexible or maladaptive, and interfere with the person’s ability to adapt to or manage changes in their circumstances or environment. Personality disorder involves both:<br>The aetiology of personality disorder is complex, involving an interplay between factors that predispose a person to a vulnerable temperament (eg familial risk, prenatal exposures), deficits in the caregiving environment in infancy, and ongoing maladaptive social experiences [Note 1]. This results in the deficits in emotional regulation and social communication seen in a person with personality disorder. Although adverse life experiences in childhood (eg trauma, abuse, neglect) are associated with personality disorder, and should be considered when personality disorder is suspected, adverse experiences are nonspecific to personality disorder. In addition, some patients with personality disorder report no adversity in childhood.<br>Personality disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, the prevalence in clinical settings is higher because people with personality disorder seek treatment more frequently—personality disorder is prevalent in a quarter of patients attending primary care and up to half of patients attending specialist psychiatric services.<br>Personality disorder usually becomes apparent during the transition from childhood to adulthood, when the capacity for self-reflection and a life narrative is developed.

Personality is considered normal when it allows a person to adapt to their circumstances and environment, but what is considered normal can depend on cultural norms (eg high emotional expression is expected in some societies but not others). Personality disorder occurs when features of a person’s personality are inflexible or maladaptive, and interfere with the person’s ability to adapt to or manage changes in their circumstances or environment. Personality disorder involves both:<br>The aetiology of personality disorder is complex, involving an interplay between factors that predispose a person to a vulnerable temperament (eg familial risk, prenatal exposures), deficits in the caregiving environment in infancy, and ongoing maladaptive social experiences [Note 1]. This results in the deficits in emotional regulation and social communication seen in a person with personality disorder. Although adverse life experiences in childhood (eg trauma, abuse, neglect) are associated with personality disorder, and should be considered when personality disorder is suspected, adverse experiences are nonspecific to personality disorder. In addition, some patients with personality disorder report no adversity in childhood.<br>Personality disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting approximately 10% of the Australian population. However, the prevalence in clinical settings is higher because people with personality disorder seek treatment more frequently—personality disorder is prevalent in a quarter of patients attending primary care and up to half of patients attending specialist psychiatric services.<br>Personality disorder usually becomes apparent during the transition from childhood to adulthood, when the capacity for self-reflection and a life narrative is developed.

Severe personality disorder usually requires a collaborative multidisciplinary approach. By following the key principles of working with patients with personality disorder, all clinicians can contribute positively to their care.<br>The therapeutic relationship between the patient and clinician is central to personality disorder management and can provide an environment that allows change. However, it can be challenging because, by definition, people with personality disorder have difficulties with interpersonal relationships (see The clinician–patient relationship in patients with a personality disorder).<br>When making a diagnosis of personality disorder, the clinician should openly and honestly discuss the diagnosis with the patient (see Psychoeducation for personality disorder). Clinicians also play an important role in addressing the stigma associated with personality disorder.<br>People with personality disorder often present during an acute crisis. Patients usually respond well to being given support and time to talk about their concerns—follow the key principles for working with a patient with personality disorder. Use simple problem-solving strategies to address immediate precipitants and involve the patient’s family, carers or significant others if possible. If these strategies are insufficient to manage the acute crisis, consider using adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Although clinicians may feel pressured by the patient to use pharmacotherapy, or compelled by a sense that alternatives are lacking, pharmacotherapy is not first line. Follow the patient’s management plan, if they have one.<br>If a patient with personality disorder is acutely agitated or has an acute behavioural disturbance, do not start treatment before determining that it is safe and appropriate to intervene. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated or at risk of harming themselves or others, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for advice on drug therapy.<br>Even if management is first initiated for an acute crisis, simultaneously plan long-term management (see Management plan for a person with personality disorder). Psychosocial interventions are the mainstay of long-term management and can include individual, group and family approaches, as well as social support and environmental modification. For many people with personality disorder, effective psychosocial interventions can be instigated in primary care, without the need for further referral. However, patients with moderate to severe personality disorder or those who do not respond to treatment should be referred to a specialist mental health service or personality disorder service [Note 2]. Pharmacological treatment has limited or no role in the management of personality disorder itself.<br>Treatment of personality disorder usually occurs in an outpatient setting to allow the patient to improve their management of day-to-day stressors and interpersonal relationships. Inpatient treatment is rarely indicated, but may be required to manage an acute crisis if other approaches (eg intensive outpatient treatment) have been unsuccessful—admissions are usually brief and should have specific goals. Inpatient treatment may also be required to treat co-occurring conditions (eg major depression, psychoses).<br>For considerations in managing personality disorder in females of childbearing potential, see here and the perinatal period, see here.<br><br>Psychoeducation for personality disorder<br>To avoid stigma around personality disorder, clinicians diagnosing the disorder need to provide psychoeducation to the patient, and their family, carers or significant others: openly and honestly discuss the diagnosis, the likely course of the disorder, treatment options and common misconceptions. Allow adequate time for the discussion.<br>Encourage the patient to ask questions and to make note of any questions that occur to them after the discussion. Be sensitive when responding to the patient’s questions, because they may already attach stigma to the diagnosis.<br>Project Air has patient information on personality disorder.<br>For general information on psychoeducation, see here.<br><br>Management plan for a patient with personality disorder<br>Collaborate with a patient with personality disorder, as well as their family, carers or significant others, to develop a tailored management plan. The management plan should include:<br>Review the management plan regularly.<br>Find templates and further advice for developing a management plan at Project Air, Spectrum or another personality disorder organisation.<br><br>The clinician–patient relationship in personality disorder management<br>The therapeutic relationship between the clinician and patient plays an important role in personality disorder management, and provides an environment that can facilitate change. It is often helpful for clinicians to remember that, when treating a person with personality disorder, they are usually seeing them at their lowest ebb, when problems are likely to be at their most severe.<br>Since personality disorder involves difficulties with empathy, intimacy, understanding others’ perspectives, managing conflict and self-reflection, the therapeutic relationship can become strained at times. The clinician should seek to understand how the person prefers to interact. In expressing their needs, the person may ask the clinician to say or do things that the clinician experiences as unrealistic or demanding. When the clinician is unable to meet these needs the patient may respond with, for example, aggression or extreme emotionality. Clinicians can often feel provoked by such encounters and reciprocate in ways that are often uncharacteristic. A flexible and self-reflective response style, acknowledging the patient’s needs while also letting the patient know the limits of what the clinician can provide, can help to maintain engagement. Clinicians should not be afraid to respectfully discuss their own limits with the patient or to seek advice from their peers.<br>Strategies to foster an effective therapeutic relationship include collaborative goal setting, being clear about mutual expectations and acceptable behaviour, encouraging the patient to develop self-control, and helping the patient to associate feelings with events and actions. Use a structured approach to personality disorder problems following the key principles in Box 8.37. Discuss the case with other clinicians.<br><br>Addressing the stigma associated with personality disorder<br>The terms used to describe personality disorder are sometimes used inappropriately, or in a pejorative manner. This may serve to stigmatise personality disorder and lead to inadequate assessment and treatment, or even denial of service. Personality disorder is a treatable condition—the behaviours that people with personality disorder display (eg being ‘difficult’ or antisocial, severe emotional or interpersonal dysregulation) should not be a reason to exclude them from a health service or deny treatment.<br>This stigma is most often perpetuated by health professionals and it is the responsibility of all clinicians to be proactive and educate their peers when this occurs. To address the stigma that currently surrounds a diagnosis of personality disorder, have an open and honest discussion with the patient at the time of diagnosis (see Psychoeducation for personality disorder) and record the diagnosis in the patient’s medical history.<br><br>Considerations in managing personality disorder in females of childbearing potential<br>Personality disorder can affect a female of childbearing potential’s sexual health and behaviour (including contraception use), relationships and pregnancies. Females who have severe personality disorder with a borderline pattern are at increased risk of early and unprotected sexual intercourse, and early and unplanned pregnancies.<br>Discuss contraception and preconception planning with patients—see here for advice. If preconception planning is possible, explicitly and supportively discuss the additional emotional and relationship challenges associated with pregnancy and parenting—highlight the importance of support throughout the perinatal period.<br><br>Considerations in managing personality disorder in the perinatal period<br>There is limited evidence about perinatal outcomes in females with personality disorder. While many people with personality disorder successfully navigate pregnancy and the perinatal period, data show that females who have severe personality disorder with a borderline pattern are more likely to:<br>The principles of managing personality disorder in the perinatal period are similar to the principles described here, with the following additional requirements:<br><br>Psychosocial interventions for personality disorder<br>The core treatment of personality disorder is psychosocial intervention. Many types of psychosocial interventions have randomised controlled trial evidence of efficacy for personality disorder [Note 4]. The most commonly studied are dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) and mentalisation-based therapy (MBT); no specific intervention has been shown to be more effective than others. Moreover, specific types of individual psychotherapy are not more effective than high-quality structured clinical care, based on a model of personality disorder. This is also known as ‘good psychiatric management’ or ‘good clinical care’ and follows the key principles of working with a person with personality disorder; this psychosocial intervention is well suited to nonspecialists. Therefore, the choice of psychosocial intervention for personality disorder is guided by:<br>Common characteristics of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for personality disorder include:<br>The patient’s motivation and engagement in treatment, and the clinician’s confidence and competence in managing personality disorder, will determine the outcome and duration of treatment. If possible, psychotherapy should occur weekly over the planned course of treatment.<br>Successful treatment usually requires the patient’s active participation. However, some individuals with severe personality disorder or certain personality traits (eg prominent dissociality in which the impact of the disorder is felt more by other people) lack sufficient motivation or incentive to change. In this circumstance, modification of the person’s environment is a treatment option. Environmental modification involves assisting other people to manage the person with personality disorder in the community and respond to them in a more adaptive and less harmful way.<br><br>Pharmacological treatment of personality disorder<br>Pharmacotherapy has a limited role in the primary treatment personality disorder; psychosocial interventions are the core treatment. However, pharmacotherapy may be considered to target specific symptoms when these are severe, cause significant functional impairment or distress, or have not been adequately addressed with psychosocial interventions—there is an absence of high-quality evidence of efficacy. Consider that patients often seek treatment when they are at their lowest ebb. Although clinicians may feel pressured by the patient to use pharmacotherapy, or compelled by a sense that alternatives are lacking, pharmacotherapy is not first line.<br>Symptoms of personality disorder that pharmacotherapy may be used to target are:<br>Before considering pharmacotherapy to target symptom(s) of personality disorder, consider if the symptom(s) could be caused by a co-occurring psychiatric disorder; for example:<br>If a co-occurring psychiatric disorder is diagnosed, its management may include pharmacotherapy. If the target symptom(s) are not better explained by a co-occurring psychiatric disorder, use psychosocial interventions first line and only consider adjunctive pharmacotherapy.<br>If considering pharmacotherapy to target symptom(s) of personality disorder, use shared decision making with the patient, and discuss the potential benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy. Consider the risk of drug dependence, abuse and overdose, and whether adherence to treatment may be an issue. Avoid using a drug that can be fatal in overdose because there is a high risk of overdose with prescribed drugs in people with severe personality disorder. Avoid using a drug to treat personality disorder in the perinatal period—see Considerations in managing personality disorder in the perinatal period. If a drug is required, see Principles of psychotropic use during pregnancy and Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding for considerations.<br>Before trialling a drug, the patient and prescriber should discuss and reach agreement on the parameters of the trial, including the target symptom(s), how the patient’s response to the drug will be monitored and measured, and the expected duration of treatment.<br>If pharmacotherapy is used to target symptom(s) of personality disorder, choose a drug that is expected to have efficacy against the target symptom(s) and consider seeking advice from a psychiatrist. If response to the drug is inadequate, withdraw the drug and consider alternate treatment options (either psychosocial or pharmacological). If using a second (or subsequent) drug, use sequential monotherapy—avoid polypharmacy, which is common among people with severe personality disorder.<br>Despite the widespread use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), evidence does not support their use for dysphoric mood or mood lability caused by personality disorder. Anxiety is a common reason for patients with personality disorder to seek treatment and can cause significant distress. Anxiety as a symptom of personality disorder should be managed in the same way as generalised anxiety disorder. Treatment of anxiety may involve use of an antidepressant for maintenance therapy, or short-term use of a benzodiazepine for anxiety that is severe and disabling, or causing the patient unacceptable distress.<br>For cognitive-perceptual symptoms, the evidence for pharmacotherapy is unclear. Antipsychotics may have some effect on specific cognitive-perceptual symptoms, but there are no randomised controlled trials of antipsychotics for hallucinations caused by personality disorder. Antipsychotics can cause serious adverse effects, and are associated with abuse. Quetiapine, in particular, is associated with problem use and overdose and, as such, is subject to monitoring by drug diversion monitoring systems in some Australian states. If considering pharmacotherapy for severe or persistent cognitive-perceptual symptoms, seek advice from a psychiatrist.<br>There is very limited evidence for pharmacotherapy for impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol—seek advice from a psychiatrist before considering pharmacotherapy.<br>People with personality disorder often present during an acute crisis. Patients usually respond well to being given support and time to talk about their concerns—follow the key principles for working with a patient with personality disorder. Use simple problem-solving strategies to address immediate precipitants and involve the patient’s family, carers or significant others if possible. If these strategies are insufficient to manage the acute crisis, consider using adjunctive short-term pharmacotherapy, with a limited supply of medication, such as:<br>If a drug is used short term, ensure the patient understands the intended duration of treatment—stop the drug once the acute crisis is resolved.<br>Using the above principles for managing personality disorder will often prevent acute agitation or behavioural disturbance. However, if symptoms of personality disorder are so severe that the patient is acutely agitated or has an acute behavioural disturbance, do not start treatment before determining that it is safe and appropriate to intervene. If possible, use nonpharmacological measures, including verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, to reduce the risk of harm. If the patient remains acutely agitated or at risk of harming themselves or others, see Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in adults or Pharmacological management for acute behavioural disturbance in older people for advice on drug therapy."

The effects of psychoactive drugs on developing brains is not without risk and it is better to avoid psychotropics in children up to 18 years of age.<br>When deciding upon a suitable dose regimen in children 12 years and older, consider the child’s developmental (physical) maturity—developmental maturity can vary between individuals of the same age (eg some 12 year olds are metabolically similar to young children, whereas others are similar to adults).<br>In a child with communication difficulties (eg suspected cognitive impairment or developmental disability), it can be difficult to distinguish behavioural disturbance related to severe acute pain from behavioural disturbance related to another cause. If unrecognised pain is thought to be a potential precipitant of distress and behavioural disturbance, a trial of analgesia is a reasonable first-line treatment rather than a sedative drug.<br>If nonpharmacological management techniques (eg environmental management [adaption], verbal de-escalation and psychological intervention, risk mitigation), have not adequately defused or settled the situation, consider pharmacological management with an oral sedative drug. Seek advice from a senior clinician before using sedation in a child.<br>A Sedation Assessment Tool (SAT) score may assist clinical decision making about whether sedation is required; however, the SAT score has not been validated for use in children. In children and people with developmental disability, if considering using the SAT score, consider the score in the context of the patient’s baseline function and communication style. Table 8.1 provides an example of a sedation assessment tool.<br>Continue nonpharmacological management techniques alongside any sedation regimen, both before and after drug administration.<br>The oral route of sedative drug administration is preferred for children with acute behavioural disturbance when there is low imminent risk of significant harm to the patient or others, the patient’s level of agitation and distress is not severe, and they are accepting of oral medication. The oral route is preferred over parenteral administration for children because:<br>It is rare to use parenteral sedative drugs for a child, though parenteral sedation may be necessary for a child with acute behavioural disturbance associated with substance use or a psychiatric disorder.

The sedative effects of antipsychotics occur much sooner than the antipsychotic effects. Although oral antipsychotics (eg haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone) are sometimes used for delirium, and BPSD, oral benzodiazepines are preferred to oral antipsychotics to manage acute behavioural disturbance in older people. This is because relatively higher doses of oral antipsychotics than oral benzodiazepines are required to achieve sedation, and serious adverse effects are more likely to occur in an older person (eg hypotension, QT-interval prolongation).<br>For an older person, lower doses of benzodiazepines are recommended than for other adults; when a dose range is given in the drug recommendations below, it is advisable that clinicians consider choosing a dose at the lower end of the range initially. The pharmacodynamic response to benzodiazepines can be variable in older people. Suitable oral benzodiazepines for older patients are lorazepam or diazepam. Lorazepam may be safer than diazepam for older people, who often have medical comorbidities such as kidney or liver impairment, because lorazepam does not have active metabolites. Diazepam has active metabolites, which prolong its duration of action after a single dose.

postpartum-psychosis,"Postpartum psychosis<br>Postpartum psychosis is a rare but dangerous condition, associated with significant risk of suicide and infanticide—it is a psychiatric emergency. Symptoms are acute and include agitation, confusion, disorganised thoughts, sleep disturbance, hallucinations, delusions and abnormal mood. Risk factors include a previous episode of postpartum psychosis and a history of bipolar disorder (including a family history). A first episode of postpartum psychosis can evolve into bipolar disorder.<br>Postpartum psychosis should be treated by a psychiatrist in a specialised centre. Typically, an antipsychotic is used, although in complex cases, lithium and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be required.<br>For advice on psychotropic use in breastfeeding, see here.<br>Patients who have had an episode of postpartum psychosis are at increased risk of further episodes in subsequent pregnancies. Once they have recovered from psychosis, discuss this risk with them; see Preventing postpartum psychosis.<br><br>Preventing postpartum psychosis<br>Postpartum psychosis often reoccurs after subsequent births. If a person with a history of postpartum psychosis becomes pregnant, seek psychiatric advice early to form a postpartum psychosis prevention plan. The plan should include prevention strategies and postpartum mental state monitoring. Limited evidence supports offering lithium or an antipsychotic late in the third trimester or immediately after birth (within 1 day postpartum). The drug that was previously effective for postpartum psychosis is usually the drug of choice. Also consider whether the patient wishes to breastfeed; antipsychotics may be used while breastfeeding whereas lithium should not be used.<br>If the patient has not had an episode of postpartum psychosis by 3 months postpartum, seek psychiatric advice to slowly reduce then stop the drug."

Using higher than recommended doses rarely improves symptoms but is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects. However, a psychiatrist may exceed the recommended dose range in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and increased doses of olanzapine (up to 30 mg daily) may be used for short-term treatment of agitation.<br>Combining antipsychotics increases the risk of adverse effects.

A throbbing headache (usually occipital) is the first symptom; any hypertensive episode should be treated urgently (see Urgent control of blood pressure).<br>Directly acting sympathomimetic amines (eg adrenaline [epinephrine], dopamine, isoprenaline, noradrenaline [norepinephrine]) are inactivated primarily by catechol-O-methyltransferase, not monoamine oxidase; they can be used cautiously in combination with a MAOI while monitoring blood pressure.<br>For a detailed listing of drug interactions with MAOIs, see the product information for individual drugs or an appropriate reference (eg Stockley’s Drug Interactions).

It does not contain comprehensive information on all psychological interventions.<br>Psychological interventions are an important treatment component for psychiatric disorders, either as an alternative or adjunct to pharmacotherapy. The choice of psychological intervention depends on the efficacy of specific interventions for the patient’s psychiatric disorder, the typical needs of patients with that psychiatric disorder, and the needs of the individual patient.<br>Depending on the intervention, psychological interventions may be delivered by a psychiatrist, psychologist, suitably trained general medical practitioner, counsellor, mental health nurse, social worker or other clinician.

The external stimulus is most commonly clinician-directed lateral eye movements, although bilateral tactile tapping or auditory stimulation may also be used. Other components of treatment include replacing negative cognitions of the event with more adaptive ones, and relaxation techniques.<br>Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing is guided by the Adaptive Information Processing Model, which postulates that memories formed during traumatic experiences are inadequately processed and when these are recalled, may trigger distressing physiological responses similar to those experienced during the traumatic event itself.

psychotropic-use-breastfeeding,"What is covered in this topic?<br>This topic is intended to support the practical implementation of the psychotropic recommendations for nonacute indications in these guidelines. For advice on the use of other drugs during breastfeeding, consult a drug information resource. This topic may be relevant for any person who is breastfeeding; this includes cis women, trans men and nonbinary people.<br>For information on the use of the following drugs while breastfeeding, see:<br><br>Overview of psychotropic breastfeeding data<br>The recommendations in these guidelines for psychotropic use while breastfeeding are drawn on expert consensus based on evidence of low to moderate quality.<br>Although there is no reason to suspect that a psychotropic would be ineffective during breastfeeding, there have been no randomised controlled trials, so the effectiveness of psychotropics in this patient group remains unproven. Breastfeeding safety data are limited to observational studies that have significant confounders (eg psychiatric disorder, alcohol and nicotine use) but data quality continues to improve as confounders are more effectively controlled.<br><br>Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding<br>All psychotropics are excreted into breastmilk (albeit to varying degrees)—if a psychotropic is taken while breastfeeding, the infant will be exposed to it. This being said, the placental transfer of most drugs exceeds breastmilk excretion, and, generally, the concentration of the drug in breastmilk is significantly lower than the therapeutic concentration for infants.<br>The benefits of breastfeeding are sufficiently important to encourage breastfeeding unless there is substantial evidence that the drug will harm the infant and no alternative is available.<br>Discuss the approach to psychotropic use in breastfeeding with the patient and, if the patient consents, their significant other(s) so they can make an informed choice (see also Shared decision making). There are 4 options to consider:<br>Table 8.27 provides a framework to help decide whether to use a psychotropic while breastfeeding. Exercise particular caution if the infant is premature, has a low birth weight, is physically ill, or has an impaired ability to metabolise or excrete drugs.<br>Infant<br>Patient<br>Potential harms of psychotropic use<br>Potential benefits of psychotropic use<br>There is no risk-neutral or universally applicable treatment for a patient with a psychiatric disorder who is breastfeeding; individualise treatment based on the considerations listed above.<br>Avoid polypharmacy and drugs with long half-life (eg diazepam) and use the lowest possible dose in patients who are breastfeeding to reduce the risk of accumulation in the breastfed infant. Monitor the infant for excessive sedation, irritability, agitation and gastrointestinal dysfunction (eg colic, poor feeding). However, before attributing these symptoms to a drug, consider alternative causes—there is a high incidence of these problems in all infants. If the infant’s symptoms are severe or clearly caused by the drug, discuss the preferred approach with the parent.<br>For the latest updates, newsletters and patient handouts on the use of drugs while breastfeeding, see:<br>The Principles of psychotropic use in females of childbearing potential also apply to patients who are breastfeeding.<br><br>Antidepressant use while breastfeeding<br>Consider the advice for antidepressant use while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.<br>The placental transfer and fetal exposure to antidepressants in utero is much greater than breastmilk exposure. Therefore, if a patient has taken an antidepressant during pregnancy, and delivered a healthy neonate, continue the antidepressant while breastfeeding. Do not switch to another antidepressant with a lower breastmilk concentration.<br>If an antidepressant is started while breastfeeding for a new-onset disorder, use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) other than fluoxetine. Fluoxetine passes into breastmilk to a greater extent than other SSRIs and has along half-life with the potential to accumulate in the breastfed infant. Fluoxetine has been associated with low weight gain, irritability, difficulty settling and infant gastrointestinal dysfunction. Sertraline has the most safety data in breastfeeding and is recommended first line.<br>No adverse neurological or developmental adverse outcomes have been observed in infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine in breastmilk. Isolated cases of irritability, sleep disturbance and colic, which remitted when breastfeeding or the antidepressant was stopped, have been reported.<br>Except for doxepin, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are considered safe while breastfeeding. Avoid doxepin; there have been isolated case reports of sedation and respiratory depression in infants. Neurodevelopmental effects of TCA breastmilk exposure are unknown—data are limited.<br>Moclobemide has very low transfer into breastmilk and may be used with caution. Agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mianserin, mirtazapine, phenelzine, reboxetine, tranylcypromine and vortioxetine have not been adequately studied.<br>For advice on antidepressant use in females of childbearing potential, see here.<br><br>Antiepileptic use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding<br>Consider the advice on antiepileptic use for psychiatric disorders while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.<br>Sodium valproate and carbamazepine are considered safe to use while breastfeeding, although sodium valproate should be avoided in females of childbearing potential. Monitor weight gain and alertness in infants.<br>Although lamotrigine passes into breastmilk in higher and more variable amounts than carbamazepine and sodium valproate, it has not been associated with problematic adverse effects in infants. Lamotrigine can be taken while breastfeeding with close infant monitoring. If the infant develops a rash, stop breastfeeding until the cause is known—exclude Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (although there have been no case reports of this occurring as a result of breastmilk exposure). If there are serious concerns about lamotrigine impacting an infant, seek expert advice and consider monitoring the infant’s lamotrigine blood concentration.<br>The effect of pregabalin on an infant while breastfeeding is unknown. Limited data suggest that a small amount of pregabalin passes into breastmilk; consider alternative treatments, especially in neonates and premature infants.<br>For advice on antiepileptic use in females of childbearing potential, see here.<br><br>Antipsychotic use while breastfeeding<br>Consider the advice for antipsychotic use while breastfeeding in accordance with the Principles of psychotropic use while breastfeeding.<br>Data on antipsychotic use while breastfeeding are limited to case reports and about half of these concern olanzapine. Except for clozapine, antipsychotics appear safe in breastfeeding, but should be used with caution. Avoid breastfeeding with clozapine; it achieves a high concentration in breastmilk and there is a theoretical risk of infant agranulocytosis. Advise the patient to stop breastfeeding and continue clozapine.<br>Olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone have low infant doses relative to maternal weight-adjusted dose (relative infant dose). Moderate relative infant doses are described for aripiprazole, risperidone and paliperidone. Amisulpride has been associated with high relative infant doses. Adverse events have rarely been reported in infants.

psychotropic-use-children,"Principles of psychotropic use in children<br>There is limited evidence for the efficacy and safety of psychotropics in children—most trials have small sample sizes and are of short duration, and few are placebo controlled. Consequently, many psychotropics do not have approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in children (see Off-label prescribing for psychiatric disorders).<br>Data on psychotropic use in adults cannot necessarily be extrapolated to children because of age-related differences in drug metabolism and effect. It is also not known how psychotropics may affect long-term neurodevelopment.<br>In children who are obese, it may be necessary to use ideal body weight to calculate the appropriate drug dose.<br>Nonpharmacological treatment is usually preferred in children with psychiatric disorders. If psychotropics are required, they should ideally be started, and reviewed at least 6-monthly, by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children. Depending on the disorder and the availability of services, oversight can be provided by a child or youth psychiatrist, a paediatrician, a physician with expertise in paediatric psychopharmacology, or an age-appropriate mental health service.<br>Set clear, measurable goals for pharmacotherapy. Use symptom checklists, screening questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews to establish the child’s baseline, and repeat the same assessment periodically to determine efficacy and adverse effects. Children often require more frequent review than adults.<br>Avoid polypharmacy in children unless there is a good rationale for combining drugs, such as using drugs with different mechanisms to target different symptoms or disorders—document the target symptoms of each drug. If polypharmacy is necessary, consult a clinician with expertise in paediatric psychopharmacology.<br>When using a psychotropic in an older child, obtain informed consent from the child as well as their family or carers.

recovery-relapse-prevention-psychoses,"Principles of recovery and relapse prevention in psychoses including schizophrenia<br>Although most people who have a psychotic episode return to a productive life, this process is complex and multifaceted; antipsychotic therapy is an important component of recovery. Continuous therapy with the antipsychotic the patient best tolerates is also the most effective way to reduce relapse and prevent suicide. See Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia for the approach to facilitating recovery, preventing relapse and suicide, and improving quality of life and overall health.<br>The treatment advice in this topic applies to adults and young people; antipsychotic therapy for recovery and relapse prevention in children follows the same principles but should be guided by a child psychiatrist or an age-appropriate mental health service.<br>Continue antipsychotic therapy (with monitoring for adverse effects) for an adequate duration after a psychotic episode. For duration of antipsychotic therapy after a first episode of psychosis, see here. Longer-term treatment is required if relapse occurs—seek psychiatric advice.<br>Do not use intermittent therapy (‘drug holidays’) during treatment, because restarting an antipsychotic early in relapse is not as effective as continuous therapy.<br>Most patients who recover from a first episode of psychosis experience a relapse. Relapse is usually associated with poor adherence or stopping antipsychotic therapy as part of the treatment plan—see Box 8.41 for other contributors to relapse.<br>If a patient is poorly adherent to oral antipsychotic therapy, address this with psychosocial interventions and by monitoring for and addressing adverse effects—see also Adherence to psychotropics.

schizoaffective-disorder,"Schizoaffective disorder<br>Schizoaffective disorder is often diagnosed in patients with features of both schizophrenia, and bipolar depression or severe major depression during the majority of their disorder; however, the diagnosis is controversial.<br>The already very limited evidence base to guide treatment of schizoaffective disorder has been further undermined by changes in the diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, the principles of treating schizoaffective disorder are the same as the Principles of treating psychoses including schizophrenia and the relevant mood disorder (see Principles of managing bipolar depression in adults and young people or Principles of treating major depression in adults and young people). Drug therapy should be overseen by a psychiatrist.

separation-anxiety-disorder,"Overview of separation anxiety disorder<br>Separation anxiety disorder is characterised by excessive and developmentally inappropriate anxiety related to being away from home or separated from significant attachment figures. Anxiety can also be experienced when there is a threat of these events. The fear and anxiety that the person experiences is persistent, and leads to avoidance of separation. At the time of separation, anxiety may reach the point of panic. The disorder is associated with clinically significant distress, or impairment in social, academic or other important areas of functioning. Separation anxiety disorder was previously only recognised in children with at least 1 month of symptoms, but is now also recognised in adults and young people with at least 6 months of symptoms. It remains an uncommon diagnosis in adulthood—most patients have comorbid major depression or another anxiety disorder.<br>Children with separation anxiety disorder often fear that a disaster will prevent them reuniting with their parents. This leads to persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home, or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure. Nightmares with themes of separation are common. The child may refuse to go to school or have somatic symptoms (eg headache, abdominal pain) related to school attendance. It is thought that separation anxiety disorder in childhood is associated with panic disorder or agoraphobia in adulthood.<br>For treatment considerations for females of childbearing potential, including advice on contraception, preconception planning and psychotropic use, see here.<br>For considerations in managing anxiety disorders such as separation anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, see here or for considerations in partners see, here.<br>For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.<br><br>Psychosocial interventions for separation anxiety disorder<br>At the time of diagnosis, provide psychoeducation to the patient and, if relevant, their family, carers or significant others.

social-anxiety-disorder,"Overview of social anxiety disorder<br>Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is associated with a persistent, excessive fear or anxiety of social situations in which the person may be exposed to the scrutiny of others. The fear may be experienced in one or more social situations, including performing in front of others (eg speaking in public), social interactions and being observed (eg eating or drinking in public). The person anticipates that they will be negatively evaluated by others, and fears that they may say something or act in a way that is humiliating or embarrassing. The phobic situations are avoided, or endured with intense anxiety or distress. Unlike common, transient social fears, fear or anxiety in social anxiety disorder is recurrent and lasts for at least 6 months.<br>If a person experiences social anxiety in discrete performance situations only (eg public speaking) and does not avoid other social situations, they are considered to have performance anxiety rather than social anxiety disorder.<br>The disorder often begins in childhood. Anxiety in children can manifest as tantrums, shyness at school, crying, clinging or immobility, and may lead to significant impairment in social and academic functioning. For a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder in children, anxiety must be identified in both peer settings and during encounters with adults.<br>Comorbid problem drug and alcohol use and major depression are common.

Short-term use of diazepam can alleviate fear and anxiety, until the patient can achieve some control of the phobia using other methods. A common example is the need to manage a phobia of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) in a patient who requires a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination; in this situation, give a single dose of diazepam before the examination.<br>However, benzodiazepine use is associated with increased risk of falls, memory problems, motor vehicle accidents, daytime sedation and dependence.

Other specific phobias occur in children, such as fear of loud sounds (balloon popping) and costumed characters (clowns). The prevalence of specific phobias in children is approximately 10 to 35% and the mean age of onset is 5 to 12 years.<br>For information on diagnosing and differentiating anxiety disorders, see Overview of anxiety disorders.<br>Use psychological interventions (including behavioural therapy with a graded exposure component) as first-line treatment of a specific phobia.

Virtual-reality exposure is emerging as a convenient approach, but it is not clear if it is superior to real-world exposure.<br>Pharmacotherapy is rarely indicated for managing a specific phobia in a child. If the phobia results in extreme incapacitation and pharmacotherapy is considered, refer to a child psychiatrist or age-appropriate mental health service."
stopping-antidepressants,"Approach to stopping an antidepressant<br>Although long-term antidepressant therapy may be required, rates of antidepressant use in Australia (1 in 10 adults take an antidepressant) suggest antidepressant therapy is continued unnecessarily in some people.<br>Consider stopping a person’s antidepressant treatment if:<br>In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to switch to another antidepressant rather than stopping antidepressant therapy.<br>Stopping or switching an antidepressant may be considered because a patient wishes to become pregnant, or is pregnant or breastfeeding.<br>Discontinuation symptoms can occur when stopping an antidepressant. Discontinuation symptoms vary between antidepressants, but can include insomnia, nausea, postural imbalance, sensory disturbances, hyperarousal, influenza-like symptoms and, rarely, delirium. Discontinuation symptoms are usually mild and last 1 to 2 weeks (but can last a month or longer in some patients). If severe, restarting the antidepressant will resolve the symptoms promptly; a slower dose reduction can be used to avoid discontinuation symptoms.<br>If relapse occurs after stopping an antidepressant, consider whether long-term pharmacotherapy is required.<br>In some circumstances, another psychotropic will be started when the antidepressant is stopped; antidepressant discontinuation symptoms may be mistaken for adverse effects of the new drug. This can lead to the dose of the new drug being inappropriately reduced or the drug being stopped. If clinical circumstances permit, slowly stop the antidepressant, allow time for discontinuation symptoms to manifest, then introduce the new drug.<br>Plan antidepressant discontinuation with the patient. To facilitate stopping an antidepressant:<br><br>Gradual dose reduction to stop an antidepressant<br>Reduce the dose of the antidepressant gradually, rather than stopping it abruptly, to reduce the risk of discontinuation symptoms. For example, reduce the antidepressant dose by 25 to 50% every 1 to 4 weeks until the daily dose is half the lowest unit strength available [Note 1]. Continue at the lowest dose for 2 weeks then stop.<br>However, if a serious adverse effect has occurred, reduce the dose more rapidly.<br>Conversely, use a slower dose reduction schedule than described above if discontinuation symptoms are more likely; for example, when stopping:<br>A gradual dose reduction is not usually required for fluoxetine because fluoxetine and its active metabolite have a long half-life; discontinuation symptoms rarely occur."

substance-induced-psychosis,"Substance-induced psychosis<br>Transient psychotic symptoms can be caused by intoxication with a substance (eg stimulants, hallucinogens, gamma-hydroxybutyrate [GHB], ketamine) or, more rarely, withdrawal from a substance (eg alcohol, benzodiazepines). Symptoms development is related to the time the substance was last ingested, and symptom duration is usually brief. Occasionally, perceptual abnormalities (eg flashbacks to hallucinogen use) occur sometime after the last use of the substance. Predominant psychotic symptoms are hallucinations or delusions, but a degree of insight is usually preserved; disordered thoughts or blunted affect do not usually occur, although an amotivational state can occur with chronic cannabis use. For advice on managing a person who is intoxicated, see the Toxicology and Toxinology guidelines.<br>Psychotic symptoms that continue for longer than can be attributed to intoxication with or withdrawal from a substance may be due to a substance-induced psychotic disorder. This can be triggered by substance use in people with risk factors for psychosis (eg genetic susceptibility). Seek psychiatric advice for treatment of substance-induced psychosis, which can include treating problem substance use, supporting sobriety, and antipsychotic therapy. If a substance-induced psychotic disorder continues for longer than 4 weeks, it is likely to be another psychotic disorder (eg schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia).<br>For information on assessing a person with new-onset psychotic symptoms, including differential diagnoses, see Assessing a first episode of psychosis in adults and young people."

suicide-risk,"Assessing suicide risk<br>Suicide is a significant cause of death in Australia. It is the leading cause of death in people aged 15 to 44 years, and the third leading cause of death for people aged 45 to 55 years. Suicide is more common in males than females (75% of suicide deaths are in males), in minority groups, and in individuals with poor socioeconomic status (eg unemployed, homeless, economic insecurity).<br>Self-harm is a risk factor for suicide, but many patients who self-harm do not report having an intention to die. The management of patients who deliberately self-harm is beyond the scope of these guidelines.<br>Assessing suicide risk is a standard and crucial component of psychiatric assessments and mental health plans, but it is inherently difficult to reliably predict an individual’s risk of suicide. For examples of risk factors associated with suicide, see Table 8.24—this is not an exhaustive list of risk factors or a ‘check list’ for assessing suicide risk. Use the risk factors for suicide as a prompt to inform discussions with the patient.<br>Risk factors for suicide can be:<br>While it is very difficult to predict an individual’s behaviour, the presence of static and dynamic risk factors is associated with suicide or severe self-harm and should raise concern and instigate referral to an acute psychiatric service or acute mental health team.

If switching from an antidepressant with a higher risk of discontinuation symptoms (eg paroxetine, venlafaxine), a drug-free interval may be preferable, except in urgent clinical situations (eg patients who are severely depressed, suicidal or psychotic).<br>Rapid switch and cross-tapering methods require an experienced clinician because drug interactions and serotonin toxicity are more likely with these methods. Keep in mind that discontinuation symptoms from the antidepressant that has been stopped may be misattributed to adverse effects of the new antidepressant. See Stopping treatment with an antidepressant for further information about discontinuation symptoms.<br>If using the drug-free interval method, see Table 8.29 for recommendations; these are based on the pharmacokinetics of the drug to be stopped and any active metabolites. Interpret these recommendations in the context of each patient’s situation (eg doses of the drugs, concurrent drugs, physical health).<br>Regardless of the method used to switch antidepressants, create a management plan that includes:<br>If significant adverse effects emerge during the changeover period, the plan may need to be adjusted.<br>Click on the antidepressant that is being

switching-antipsychotics,"Switching antipsychotics<br>The advice in this topic is intended to support the practical implementation of the antipsychotic recommendations for adults and young people with bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders.<br>A switch of antipsychotic may be required because of poor treatment response, adverse effects or patient request.<br>If a switch is being considered because of poor treatment response, first check whether the poor response can be explained by other factors (see Box 8.41 for psychotic disorders, Box 8.17 for acute mania, Box 8.18 for bipolar depression and Box 8.19 for prophylaxis of bipolar disorder). If nonadherence is identified as the cause of poor treatment response, determine barriers to adherence (eg antipsychotic adverse effects, impaired insight, cognitive impairment, lack of community or family support, psychosocial factors including financial, inadequate community treatment and lack of patient or caregiver education). These barriers may be the focus of treatment (eg addressing factors contributing to nonadherence) or guide the subsequent antipsychotic selection. If negative symptoms of psychosis are inadequately treated, see the management advice here before switching antipsychotics.<br>If treatment response is adequate but the patient is experiencing adverse effects, see here for management options to consider before switching antipsychotics.<br>Before switching antipsychotics, discuss the potential harms (eg relapse, temporary exacerbation of adverse effects) and benefits (eg improved symptom control, eventual reduction in adverse effects) of a switch with the patient and, if the patient consents, their family, carers or significant others.<br>If the decision is made to switch antipsychotics:<br>The speed of a switch between oral antipsychotics depends on the pharmacokinetics of the antipsychotics (check a drug information resource for guidance), whether the patient is acutely unwell or stable, and the setting in which the switch is undertaken (eg hospital, community). For example:<br>For information about switching from an oral to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulation, see here for psychotic disorders and here for bipolar disorder.<br>When switching from a long-acting injectable to an oral antipsychotic formulation, stop the long-acting injectable and start a low dose of the oral antipsychotic on the date the next injection was due. Gradually increase the dose of the oral formulation—concentrations of long-acting injectable antipsychotics remain elevated for weeks to months depending on their pharmacokinetics (check a drug information resource). The exception to this approach is long-acting injectable risperidone; start the replacement oral antipsychotic early enough to achieve a therapeutically equivalent dose 3 weeks after the last risperidone injection (which is when the risperidone concentration is expected to rapidly drop). Adverse effects arising during the switch may be caused by the long-acting formulation (either an interaction with the new antipsychotic or withdrawal adverse effects) or the oral antipsychotic. If symptoms return after the long-acting injectable formulation drops to clinically insignificant concentrations (usually 2 to 5 months after the last dose, depending on pharmacokinetics), this can indicate the oral antipsychotic is inadequately dosed; also consider other factors for nonresponse."
tourette-syndrome,"Overview of Tourette syndrome<br>Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder with childhood onset that can cause significant social disability. The disorder is characterised by multiple motor tics and one or more recurrent vocal tics. Tourette syndrome is more common in males than females. Severity typically peaks during adolescence with many children experiencing a substantial reduction in severity by early adulthood. The prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is greatly increased among children with Tourette syndrome.<br>Typically, motor tics begin between the ages of 3 and 8 years, with vocal tics appearing several years later. Vocal tics can involve sniffing, grunting, swallowing, coughing, barking, whistling or uttering expletives. Tics occur many times a day, are present over a period longer than 1 year and there is often a waxing and waning pattern of severity, intensity and frequency.<br>If Tourette syndrome is suspected, refer to a specialist for confirmation of the diagnosis.<br>Most people with Tourette syndrome have a comorbid psychiatric disorder, which can have a greater impact on the patient than the tics. Effective management of psychiatric comorbidities may reduce tic intensity.<br>Symptoms of Tourette syndrome should be differentiated from transient simple motor tics of less than 6 months duration, which are common in otherwise healthy children. Advice and support for children and parents is the best management in these circumstances. For the management of tics not associated with Tourette syndrome, see here.<br>Nonpharmacological treatment is first line for management of Tourette syndrome. If Tourette syndrome is severe or debilitating, consider using pharmacotherapy. While Tourette syndrome improves significantly in adulthood, a minority of adults will continue to have significant symptoms and may require continued treatment.<br><br>Nonpharmacological treatment for Tourette syndrome<br>Providing psychoeducation to patients, parents, teachers and peers and exploring associated coping strategies is typically sufficient for most people with Tourette syndrome, unless tics are severe or debilitating.<br>Identify and address any specific environmental stresses or precipitants that may exacerbate the condition.<br>The most studied nonpharmacological intervention for Tourette syndrome is habit reversal training [Note 1]. Patients usually experience an urge to tic called the ‘premonitory sensation’, which is often relieved by performing the tic. For most patients, this is an automatic and involuntary process. However, through awareness training, patients can become more aware of this urge and use competing responses to oppose the tic.<br>The Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics (CBIT) involves habit reversal training and psychosocial support. Randomised controlled trial evidence has demonstrated that Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics is effective in children and adults. Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics addresses tics sequentially.<br>There is preliminary evidence to suggest that exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy may also be effective in the treatment of tics. This therapy encourages patients to fully experience urges to tic while actively suppressing tics during therapeutic sessions. Unlike Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics, exposure and response prevention focuses on all tics at the same time.<br>Adults who have severe, refractory tics that cause significant impairment in functioning may be treated with other therapies, including deep brain stimulation.<br><br>Pharmacotherapy for Tourette syndrome in children<br>Pharmacotherapy should be prescribed by a clinician with expertise in using psychotropics in children—follow the principles of psychotropic use in children.<br>Pharmacotherapy may be considered for Tourette syndrome if tics cause pain or injury, cause sustained academic, social or emotional difficulties for the child, or interfere significantly with the child’s functioning in other areas. However, pharmacotherapy rarely achieves complete suppression of all tics; instead, treatment aims to reduce the tic frequency and severity sufficiently, without causing significant adverse effects.<br>Effective treatment of comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms may help reduce tic severity.<br>If drug therapy is considered appropriate for Tourette syndrome, clonidine is used first line because, despite being less efficacious than antipsychotics, it is not associated with significant adverse effects. Clonidine may be more effective for Tourette syndrome in children with comorbid ADHD, and can also have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms. Use:<br>Although slowly increasing the dose of clonidine (as above) limits sedation and hypotension, routinely measure blood pressure and pulse rate during treatment. Avoid stopping treatment suddenly because of the risk of rebound hypertension.<br>If Tourette syndrome is not well controlled with clonidine, consider using an antipsychotic. Antipsychotics with some evidence for reducing tic severity include risperidone and aripiprazole [Note 3]. There is limited evidence for ziprasidone for reducing tic severity. Haloperidol has some evidence of efficacy for Tourette syndrome, but its use is limited by its risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Pimozide is no longer used due to cardiovascular adverse effects.<br>Discuss the following with the patient and their family, carers or significant others so they can make an informed decision about antipsychotic use:<br>If antipsychotic therapy is agreed upon, perform baseline tests to guide antipsychotic choice and to give a reference point for future monitoring. For a schedule for monitoring antipsychotic adverse effects, see here.<br>If an antipsychotic is considered appropriate for treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome, use:<br>If a patient develops adverse effects while taking an antipsychotic, see here.<br><br>Pharmacotherapy for Tourette syndrome in adults<br>While Tourette syndrome improves significantly in adulthood, a minority of adults will continue to have significant tics and may require continued treatment. Drug choice and dosing in adults is similar to that in children; however, treatment should be guided by a specialist."
transcranial-magnetic-stimulation,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation<br>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive treatment that uses a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce weak electric currents in the cerebral cortex and stimulate nerve cells.<br>There is considerable evidence to support TMS for patients with major depression who have not responded to or have only partially responded to antidepressants. There is insufficient evidence to support TMS as first-line treatment of major depression, and its role in preventing relapse of depression is unclear. TMS is less effective than electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for more severe cases of major depression.<br>TMS is a relatively new treatment and its application to other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia or obsessive compulsive disorder, is under investigation.<br>TMS is administered by trained psychiatrists in an outpatient setting and does not require anaesthesia. Treatment is administered as a series of repeated pulses (repetitive TMS [rTMS]). The frequency of treatment sessions and total duration of the treatment course is variable and determined by the treating psychiatrist, but is usually administered as daily treatment sessions over a course of 2 to 4 weeks. Further courses of TMS may be considered, but the role of maintenance TMS is unclear.<br>TMS is generally well tolerated; induction of a seizure is an extremely rare adverse effect. Depending on stimulus parameters, patients may experience local scalp discomfort and headaches. Unlike ECT, there are few interactions between psychotropics and TMS, but any changes to pharmacotherapy should be made under the guidance of the treating psychiatrist.<br>Evidence to support the use of TMS in pregnancy is limited, but suggests it improves symptoms of depression and is unlikely to cause harm."
